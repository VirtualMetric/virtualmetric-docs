# Add Your First Device

## What is a Device?

A Device represents your data source in DataStream. It defines how DataStream receives data from systems like:
- **Syslog servers** - Network devices, firewalls, routers, switches
- **Windows Event Logs** - Security events, system logs from Windows servers
- **HTTP endpoints** - Webhook data from applications and services
- **TCP/UDP streams** - Custom protocols and data feeds
- **Cisco eStreamer** - Real-time security intelligence from Cisco devices

Devices are categorized as either **Push** (they listen for incoming data) or **Pull** (they actively collect data using agents).

## Choosing Your Device Type

For this getting started guide, we'll create a **Syslog Device** because:
- Most network infrastructure supports syslog
- It's easy to test with common tools
- Many security devices use syslog by default
- It demonstrates the core concepts clearly

## Create Your Syslog Device

1. **Navigate to Devices**
   - From Home dashboard: **Fleet Management** â†’ **Devices**
   - Click the **Syslog** card under **Push** devices

2. **Start Device Creation**
   - Click **Add new device**
   - You'll see the device creation form with multiple tabs

3. **Configure General Settings** (First Tab)
   - **Name**: "My First Syslog Device"
   - **Description**: "Learning syslog collection"
   - **Tags**: Leave blank for now
   - **Device Status**: Ensure the toggle is **enabled** (blue)
   - **Director(s) for the Device**: Select the Director you created earlier
   - **Preprocessing pipeline**: Leave blank for now
   - Click **Next step**

4. **Configure Protocol Settings** (Second Tab)
   - **Authentication Protocol**: UDP (default - most common)
   - **IP Address**: 0.0.0.0 (listens on all network interfaces)
   - **Port**: 514 (standard syslog port)
   - Click **Next step**

:::info Important
Make sure port 514 is open for inbound traffic on your network and firewall. This allows syslog sources to send data to your DataStream device.
:::

5. **Advanced Configuration** (Third Tab)
   - You can accept all the default values for now:
     - **Socket address reuse**: Enabled
     - **Max Connections**: 1000
     - **Timeout**: 300 seconds
     - **Max Message Size**: 20 MB
     - **Buffer Size**: 9000 bytes
   - Click **Add device**

## Verify Your Device

Your device should now appear in the Syslog devices table with:
- **Status**: Enabled
- **Port**: 514
- **Protocol**: UDP
- **Director**: Your Director's name

## Test Your Device (Optional)

Want to verify your device is working? You can send a test syslog message:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
logger -n <your-server-ip> -P 514 "Test message from DataStream setup"
```

**Windows PowerShell (requires syslog client):**
```powershell
# Use your preferred syslog testing tool or install one like "Posh-Syslog"
```

You won't see the processed data yet because we haven't set up a Target or Route, but your Director logs should show the message was received.

## Alternative Device Types

**Need to collect different data?**

- **Windows Event Logs**: 
  - Choose **Windows** under Pull devices
  - Requires installing an Agent on Windows machines
  - Great for security monitoring and system diagnostics

- **HTTP Webhook Data**:
  - Choose **HTTP** under Push devices  
  - Perfect for application logs and API integrations
  - Supports JSON payloads and authentication

- **Other Network Protocols**:
  - **TCP**: For reliable, connection-based data streams
  - **UDP**: For high-throughput, low-latency data collection
  - **eStreamer**: For Cisco security appliance integration

## What's Next?

Your device is now listening for data. Next, we need to configure where that data should go by creating a Target.

**Next:** [Configure Your First Target](configure-first-target) to define where your processed data will be stored.
