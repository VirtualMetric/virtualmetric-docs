# Includes Index

This page lists all available include IDs (from `includes.json`) that you can embed with the `<Include id="..." />` component.

| ID | File |
|----|------|
{Object.entries(includes).map(([id, file]) => `| ${id} | ${file} |`).join('\n')}

> Maintenance: update `includes.json` to add or remove include content. No code changes required for lazy loading.
