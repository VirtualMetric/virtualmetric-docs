# Targets: Overview

**Director** uses _targets_ as the output destinations to forward, store, and analyze collected telemetry data. Targets provide flexible options for data persistence and integration with various analysis platforms.

## Definitions

Targets serve as the endpoint destinations for processed data within the **Director** system. They operate on the following principles:

1. **Output Configuration**: Targets define where and how data should be delivered after processing.
2. **Format Adaptation**: They handle the conversion of internal data structures to destination-specific formats.
3. **Delivery Management**: Targets manage connection pooling, batching, and retry mechanisms.
4. **Destination Integration**: They provide authentication and protocol-specific features for various systems.

:::note
Targets enable:

> **Persistence**: Local and remote storage with various retention options.\
> **Integration**: Seamless connection to analytics platforms and messaging systems.

They also support _data transformation_, and _delivery confirmation_.
:::

## Configuration

All targets share the following base configuration fields:

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`name`|Y||Unique identifier for the target|
|`description`|N||Optional explanation|
|`type`|Y||Target type|
|`status`|N|`true`|Enable/disable the target|
|`batch_size`|N|`1000`|Records per batch|

:::tip
Each target type provides specific configuration options detailed in their respective sections.
:::

Use the `name` of the target to refer to it in your configurations.

**Example**:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: elasticsearch
    type: elasticsearch
    properties:
      hosts: ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]
      index: "logs-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
      username: "elastic"
      password: "${PASSWORD}"
```

The target listed here is of type `elasticsearch`. It specifies the _host_ that it will forward the data to and the _index_ on the host to which the data will be appended. To access the host, it specifies a _username_ and a _password_.

:::tip
You can use environment variables like `${PASSWORD}` for your credentials. This will improve security by removing the credentials from your configuration file.

## Deployment

The following deployment types can be used:

* **One-to-many** - data from a single source is routed to one or more destinations:

  > Syslog → Local Storage + Analysis Platform

* **Many-to-one** - data from multiple sources is routed to one destination:

  > Syslog + Windows → Local Storage

* **Many-to-many** - data from multiple sources is routed to multiple destinations:

  > Syslog + Windows → Local Storage
  >
  > Syslog + Elasticsearch → Cloud Upload + Analysis Platform

* **Chained** - data is routed sequentially from one destination to the next:

  > Syslog → Local Storage → Analysis Platform

Multiple targets can be used for redundancy, <Topic id="pipelines-normalization">normalization</Topic> rules can be implemented, and alerts can be put in place for notification and error handling.

## Target Types

Targets can be categorized into several functional types that serve different data management needs:

* **Analytical** - These targets integrate with platforms designed for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data:
  * Elasticsearch, Splunk, and other search and analytics engines
  
* **Storage-Based** - These targets focus on data persistence with various retention strategies:
  * Local files, S3 and other cloud storage services
  
* **Messaging** - These targets publish data to distributed messaging systems:
  * Kafka, RabbitMQ, and other message brokers

* **Integration** - These targets connect with external systems through APIs:
  * Webhooks, REST endpoints, and custom integrations

## Use Cases

The most common uses of targets are:

* **Local analysis** - Debug logging, performance analysis, audit trails, and temporary storage.

* **Cloud integration** - Long-term storage, data warehousing, security analysis, and compliance monitoring.

* **Real-time analysis** - Live monitoring, alert generation, trend analysis, and performance tracking.

* **Data lake building** - Raw data storage, schema evolution, data partitioning, and analytics preparation.

To serve these ends, the following _processing options_ are available:

* **Pipelines** - Field normalization (for ECS, CIM, ASIM, CEF, LEEF, and CSL), data transformation, message batching, custom field mapping, schema validation, and format conversion.

* **Buffer management** - Configurable buffer sizes, batch processing, flush intervals, queue management, checkpoint recovery, and error handling.

* **Performance** - Asynchronous writing, buffer optimization, connection pooling, retry mechanisms, resource monitoring, and size-based rotation.

* **Security** - Authentication using API keys, service principals, and client certificates. Encryption with TLS/SSL, HTTPS, or custom algorithms. Also, access control and audit logging.

## Implementation Strategies

### Storage Types

#### Local

**Director** supports the following local data output methods:

* **Console** - Direct _stdout_ writing with real-time message viewing. Also provides debugging and testing capability, format normalization, and synchronous writing with mutex locking

* **Files** - Multiple file formats like JSON (line-delimited), Avro (binary serialization), OCF (container), Parquet (columnar) are available. In addition, compression options like ZSTD (default), GZIP, Snappy, Brotli, and LZ4 are also supported. Also, dynamic file naming, size-based rotation, buffer management, and schema validation are among the features.

#### Cloud

The integration options for the cloud are below:

* **Azure Blob** - Direct blob writing and multiple containers are supported. Available authentication methods are service principal and managed Identity. Other features include automatic retries, exponential backoff, size-based chunking, connection pooling, and buffer management.

* **Microsoft Sentinel** - Direct DCR integration and ASIM normalization are supported. In addition to standard tables, _WindowsEvent_, _SecurityEvent_, _CommonSecurityLog_, and _Syslog_ can be used. Various ASIM tables are also available. (See the <Topic id="appendix-asim">ASIM section</Topic> for a complete list.)

### Redundant Delivery

For critical data flows, implement redundant delivery patterns:

* Primary and backup targets for important data
* Multi-region storage for disaster recovery
* Disk buffer with forward-on-recovery capability

### Routing Optimization

Configure intelligent routing based on data characteristics:

* Route high-volume data to scalable storage targets
* Send critical alerts to real-time notification endpoints
* Direct compliance data to specialized archival systems
