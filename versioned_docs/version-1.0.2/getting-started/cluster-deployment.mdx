# Getting Started: Cluster Deployment

This guide walks you through deploying a **VirtualMetric** cluster, which provides high availability, scalability, and load balancing across multiple nodes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting a cluster deployment, ensure you have:

- Multiple servers or VMs for node deployment
- Network connectivity between all nodes
- Sufficient resources on each node (CPU, memory, storage)
- Required ports open in firewalls between nodes (typically `4222` for client connections and `6222` for cluster communications)

## Cluster Architecture

A **VirtualMetric** cluster consists of:

- **Environment**: Logical grouping of resources (e.g. datacenter, region)
- **Cluster**: Group of nodes that work together
- **Nodes**: Individual servers running the VirtualMetric service

## Configuration Structure

Create a `cluster.yml` file that defines your cluster environment, and place it in the `config` directory under `<vm_root>`. The example below shows a two-node cluster configuration in the "NewYork" environment:

{/* FIXME: Nodes have to be created in odd numbers, starting from 3 */}

```yaml
environments:
  - name: "NewYork"
    description: "Datacenter1"
    status: true
    clusters:
  - name: "CLS01"
    description: "Datacenter1 CLS01"
    status: true
    type: director
    properties:
      address: "0.0.0.0"
      port: 6222
      authentication:
          username: "user1"
          password: "password1"
      tls:
          cert_name: ""
          key_name: ""
          verify: true
          status: false
    nodes:
  - name: "Node01"
    description: "10.0.0.1 ip address"
    status: true
    properties:
      address: "0.0.0.0"
      port: 4222
      cluster:
        address: "0.0.0.0"
        port: 6222
  - name: "Node02"
    description: "10.0.0.2 ip address"
    status: true
    properties:
      address: "0.0.0.0"
      port: 4223
      cluster:
        address: "0.0.0.0"
        port: 6223
      authentication:
        username: "user2"
        password: "password2"
```

## Configuration Parameters

### Environment Level

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique name for the environment (e.g. datacenter or region) |
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `status` | Enable/disable the environment (`true`/`false`) |

### Cluster Level

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique identifier for the cluster |
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `status` | Enable/disable the cluster (`true`/`false`) |
| `type` | Cluster role (e.g. "director" for primary cluster) |
| `properties.address` | Bind address for cluster communications |
| `properties.port` | Port for cluster communications (default: `6222`) |
| `properties.authentication` | Cluster-level authentication credentials |
| `properties.tls` | TLS configuration for secure cluster communications |

### Node Level

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique identifier for the node |
| `description` | Human-readable description (often includes IP or hostname) |
| `status` | Enable/disable the node (`true`/`false`) |
| `properties.address` | Bind address for client connections |
| `properties.port` | Port for client connections (default: `4222`) |
| `properties.cluster` | Node-specific cluster configuration |

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Configuration

1. Create the cluster configuration file as shown above
2. Customize environment, cluster, and node names
3. Configure appropriate IP addresses and ports
4. Set authentication credentials if needed

### 2. Deploy to Each Node

For each node in your cluster:

1. Install the **VirtualMetric** service package
2. Copy the same configuration file to each node
3. Start the service with the appropriate node name

For example, on `Node01`:

```bash
./vmetric-director -path /path/to/cluster.yml -node Node01 -cluster CLS01 -region NewYork
```

And on `Node02`:

```bash
./vmetric-director -path /path/to/cluster.yml -node Node02 -cluster CLS01 -region NewYork
```

The service will:

- Read the configuration file
- Identify its node configuration based on the provided node name
- Start the appropriate services
- Connect to other nodes in the cluster

### 3. Verify Cluster Formation

After starting all nodes, the cluster will begin to form. The service automatically:

1. Establishes connections between nodes
2. Waits for cluster functionality (visible in logs)
3. Monitors cluster health continuously
4. Attempts to recover from failures

You can verify cluster formation by checking logs for messages indicating successful cluster connections:

```powershell
VMMQ cluster service is active. All peers connected.
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

It's recommended to enable authentication for production clusters:

```yaml
authentication:
  username: "cluster_user"
  password: "secure_password"
```

Different authentication credentials can be set at both cluster and node levels.

### TLS Encryption

Enable TLS to secure communications:

```yaml
tls:
  status: true
  cert_name: "server.crt"
  key_name: "server.key"
  ca_name: "ca.crt"
  verify: true
```

Place certificate files in the service root directory on each node.

## High Availability Features

The **VirtualMetric** cluster includes several built-in HA features:

### Automatic Failure Detection

- Monitors node health every second
- Updates health status when problems are detected
- Logs warnings for cluster issues

### Self-Healing

- Automatically attempts to restart failed server components
- Monitors for shutdown signals and performs graceful shutdown
- Waits for cluster functionality on startup

### Monitoring

Three monitoring routines run continuously:

1. **Server Monitor**: Checks server health and restarts if needed
2. **Cluster Monitor**: Verifies cluster functionality
3. **Shutdown Monitor**: Ensures graceful shutdown when requested

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot find node information" error**:
   - Ensure the node name provided with the `-node` parameter exactly matches a node name in your configuration

2. **Nodes can't connect**:
   - Verify network connectivity between nodes
   - Check firewall settings for cluster ports
   - Ensure cluster addresses and ports are correctly configured

3. **Cluster warning messages**:
   - "VMMQ cluster service is not active. Waiting for other peers..."
     - This is normal during startup or when some nodes are offline
     - Check that all nodes are running and can connect to each other

4. **Authentication failures**:
   - Verify credentials match in all node configurations
   - Check for typos in usernames or passwords

## Scaling the Cluster

To add more nodes:

1. Add new node definitions to the configuration file
2. Deploy the updated configuration to all nodes
3. Start the service on the new nodes

The cluster will automatically incorporate the new nodes.
