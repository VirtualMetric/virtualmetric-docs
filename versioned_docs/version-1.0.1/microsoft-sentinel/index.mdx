## Prerequisites
- An Azure subscription with permissions to create resources
- Microsoft Sentinel requires a Log Analytics workspace - we'll create one during this setup
- Administrative access to run PowerShell or Bash commands

Open a **PowerShell** or **Terminal** with _Admin_ rights, and navigate to `<vm_root>`. Then, type the following command and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

<Tabs groupId="cli-options">
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
  ```PowerShell
  C:\<vm_root>\vmetric-director -sentinel
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
  ```bash
  ~/path/to/<vm_root>: ./vmetric-director -sentinel
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Authentication Methods

You will be presented with two authentication options:

1. **Browser Authentication**
   - Recommended for desktop environments
   - Opens a browser window automatically for Azure sign-in
   - More user-friendly and secure
   - Best for Windows/Linux systems with GUI

2. **Device Code Authentication**
   - Ideal for systems without a desktop environment (e.g., server installations, CLI-only environments)
   - Provides a code to enter at microsoft.com/devicelogin
   - Perfect for remote sessions or Linux servers without GUI
   - Useful when browser access is restricted on the local machine

Select your preferred authentication method using the arrow keys and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5,6}
Welcome to the Microsoft Sentinel Integration!

Choose Authentication Method:

> Browser Authentication
  Device Code Authentication

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'q' to quit.
```

After selecting your authentication method, the system will guide you through the authentication process.

### Browser Authentication

* A browser window will automatically open
* Sign in with your Azure credentials
* Grant the necessary permissions when prompted

### Device Code Authentication

* A code will be displayed in your terminal
* Visit microsoft.com/devicelogin in any browser
* Enter the provided code
* Sign in with your Azure credentials
* Grant the necessary permissions when prompted

### Post-Authentication

After successful authentication, you'll see this confirmation screen:

```PowerShell {1}
Authentication Successful!

You have successfully authenticated!

Press any key to proceed.
```

You have successfully authenticated! You can continue with the setup by pressing any key.

## Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinel Setup

After authentication, you'll set up the Log Analytics workspace, which is required for Microsoft Sentinel.

This documentation will guide you through creating a new Log Analytics workspace. We'll focus on the new workspace setup as it's the most comprehensive path, but here's what you should know about both options:

**Creating a New Workspace (This Guide):**
- Best for fresh installations
- Gives you full control over workspace configuration
- Ensures all required features are properly enabled
- Automatically sets up necessary permissions

**Using an Existing Workspace:**
- Skip the workspace creation steps
- Verify these prerequisites in your existing workspace:
  - Microsoft Sentinel is enabled
  - You have the necessary permissions
  - The workspace is in a supported region

:::note
If you choose to use an existing workspace, you can follow the same steps, but select "Use an existing Log Analytics Workspace" when prompted. The subsequent configuration steps will adapt accordingly.
:::

Select the first option and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short> to start with new Log Analytics Worspace creation.

```PowerShell {1,5,6}

```

You will now create a resource group. Select the first option and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5,6}
Resource Group Option

Choose how to manage the resource group:

> Create a new Resource Group
  Use an existing Resource Group

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

Provide your `<resource_group_name>` and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5}
Resource Group Name

Enter the resource group name (default: vmetric):

<your_resource_group_name>

Press enter to confirm.
```

You will now create a Log Analytics Workspace. Provide your `<instance_name>` and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5}
Instance Name

Enter the instance name (default: vmetric-loganalytics):

<your_instance_name>

Press enter to confirm.
```

**VirtualMetric Director** will now create your workspace. During this process, it will:

* Create the Log Analytics workspace
* Enable Microsoft Sentinel
* Configure the Data Collection Endpoint
* Configure necessary Data Collection Rules

```PowerShell {1,5}
Creating Workspace

Please wait while we create your workspace...

This may take a few minutes.

Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

This step may take a few minutes to complete.

## Integration Methods

After workspace setup, you'll choose between two integration methods:

```PowerShell {1,5,7}
Setup Complete

Log Analytics Workspace 'your_instance_name' is ready for use.

Press 'r' to set up an App Registration.

Press 'm' to continue with Managed Identity. (Please refer to the documentation)

Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

### App Registration

When you press <kb-short>R</kb-short>, you will proceed to App Registration. This will involve authentication via the browser which will launch automatically.

**Choose this when:**
- Running Director on non-Azure environments (on-premises servers, other cloud providers)
- Need fine-grained control over permissions
- Want to manage credentials manually
- Require credential rotation policies
- Need to share access across multiple systems

**Benefits:**
- More flexible deployment options
- Portable credentials
- Can be used anywhere with internet access
- Easier to manage in multi-tenant scenarios

```PowerShell {1}
Integration Complete

VirtualMetric Target Configuration.

targets:
  - name: sentinel
    type: sentinel
    properties:
      tenant_id: "<your-tenant-id>"
      client_id: "<your-client-id>"
      client_secret: "<your-client-secret>"
      endpoint: "https://<your-endpoint>"
      streams:
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"

Press 's' to save the configuration to the current path, press 'q' to quit.
```

### Managed Identity

Press <kb-short>M</kb-short> to proceed with Managed Identity authentication:

**Choose this when:**
- Running Director on Azure VMs
- Using Azure Arc-enabled servers
- Want to avoid managing credentials manually
- Need enhanced security with automatic credential management

**Benefits:**
- No credential management required
- Automatic rotation of credentials
- Tighter integration with Azure security
- Simpler setup and maintenance
- Enhanced security as no secrets are stored in configuration files

After the integration process completes, you will see the following output:

```PowerShell {1}
Integration Complete

VirtualMetric Target Configuration.

targets:
  - name: sentinel
    type: sentinel
    properties:
      endpoint: "https://<your-endpoint>"
      streams:
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"

Press 's' to save the configuration to the current path, press 'q' to quit.
```

:::warning
The automation program does not automatically configure permissions for the Managed Identity. You need to manually assign the required permissions in the Azure Portal.
:::

To assign the necessary permissions, follow these steps for each Data Collection Rule (DCR) that starts with "vmetric":

- Navigate to the DCR in the Azure Portal
- Select **Access Control (IAM)**
- Click **Add** > **Add role assignment**
- Assign the `Monitoring Metrics Publisher` role to your Managed Identity

**For Azure VMs:**
1. The Managed Identity is automatically created with the VM
2. Use the VM's system-assigned identity name in the role assignments

**For Azure Arc-enabled servers:**
1. Ensure Azure Arc is properly configured on your server
2. Use the Arc-enabled server's system-assigned identity name in the role assignments

:::note
If you encounter permission-related errors when running Director, verify that all required roles are properly assigned to your Managed Identity.
:::

## Configuration

From the configuration screen, copy the sentinel information by pressing <kb-short>S</kb-short> and paste it into a text editor like **Notepad**.

Create the following directory structure if it doesn't exist:

```
C:\<vm_root>\director\config\targets\
```

Then, either:
- Create a new file named `sentinel.yml` in this directory and paste the _properties_ block you copied from the screen, or
- Move your saved `sentinel.yml` file containing the copied _properties_ block to this directory.

## Validation

Once completed, validate the automation by following these steps:

1. Open your browser and navigate to the **Azure Portal: Data Collection Rules (DCR)**
2. Look for DCRs with the "`vmetric`" prefix
3. In each DCR's details page, check the **Data Sources** section to verify that the tables were created correctly
