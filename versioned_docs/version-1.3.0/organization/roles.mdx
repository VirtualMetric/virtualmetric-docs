### Role Columns

The table lists all available roles in your organization with their key characteristics:

- **Role name** - Human readable name of the role
- **Description** - Details of the role, including the actions the role has permission to carry out
- **Permissions** - Permissions assigned to the role, given in Unix-style numeric masks.

  Clicking on this value opens a list with two columns, displaying the details of the abilities or the permission set:
  
  - **Permission Title** - Internal constant representing the permission
  - **Ability** - Internal constant assigned to the permission
  
  Click again to close the table.

### Actions Menu

The **Action** menu&mdash;the vertical ellipsis (&#x22EE;) on the right&mdash;proivdes additional information on the actions the assigned permissions of the role make possible.

### Built-in Role Types

The system provides four fundamental role types with distinct permission levels:

#### User Role

_User_ has read-only access to all files, with no access to edit/delete actions.

#### Contributor Role

_Contributor_ has the same abilities as _User_, and plus can edit files and make configurations but cannot delete them.

#### Admin Role

_Admin_ has the same abilities with _Owner_ to read, edit and delete all files and make configurations, but cannot change _Owner_ information.

#### Owner Role

_Owner_ has the ability to read, edit, and delete all files and make configurations. The permissions mask is `340`.

## Role-Based Access Control

**VirtualMetric DataStream** role-based access control (RBAC) provides granular permission management for enterprise deployments, enabling organizations to control user access to telemetry processing components based on assigned roles. The system supports both built-in roles with predefined permissions and custom roles with fine-grained access controls across **DataStream** components including pipelines, devices, targets, routes, and administrative functions.

### Custom Role Management

   - **Description**: Purpose and scope of the role
   - **Configuration Method**: Select **Basic** or **Advanced**

3. **Permission Assignment**

   **Basic Configuration**:
   - **Predefined Permission Sets**: Select from common role templates
   - **Simplified Interface**: Checkbox-based permission selection

   **Advanced Configuration** (requires Advanced RBAC feature):
   - **Granular Permissions**: Individual permission selection per component
   - **Fine-grained Control**: Separate Read, Create, Edit, Delete permissions
