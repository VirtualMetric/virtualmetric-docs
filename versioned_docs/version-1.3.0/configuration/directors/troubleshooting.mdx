# Troubleshooting

This guide provides solutions to common Director deployment and operational issues. Issues are organized by category with step-by-step resolution procedures.

## Connection Issues

### Director Cannot Connect to Cloud Platform

**Symptoms:**
- Director status shows as "Not Connected" (red indicator)
- Connection verification fails during setup
- Timeout errors in Director logs

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Validate Network Connectivity**
   - Ensure port 443 is open for outbound HTTPS connections
   - Verify DNS resolution is working properly
   - Test connectivity: `curl -I https://portal.virtualmetric.com`

2. **Check Firewall Configuration**
   - Allow outbound connections to `*.virtualmetric.com` domains
   - Ensure no SSL/TLS inspection is blocking certificate validation
   - Verify proxy configurations if applicable

3. **Validate API Key**
   - Confirm the API key was copied correctly during installation
   - Check for extra spaces or line breaks in the key
   - Regenerate API key if corruption is suspected

4. **Review System Time**
   - Ensure system clock is synchronized (certificate validation requirement)
   - Use NTP to maintain accurate time synchronization
   - Check timezone configuration matches your location

**Additional Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup portal.virtualmetric.com

# Check outbound connectivity
telnet portal.virtualmetric.com 443

# Verify certificate chain
openssl s_client -connect portal.virtualmetric.com:443
```

### Connection Drops Intermittently

**Symptoms:**
- Director alternates between Connected and Not Connected states
- Periodic timeout errors in logs
- Data processing interruptions

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Network Stability Check**
   - Monitor network latency and packet loss
   - Verify network equipment stability
   - Check for bandwidth limitations or throttling

2. **Resource Monitoring**
   - Ensure adequate CPU and memory resources
   - Monitor disk I/O performance
   - Check for resource contention with other services

3. **Proxy Configuration**
   - Verify proxy server stability and configuration
   - Check proxy authentication credentials
   - Consider bypassing proxy for testing

## Installation Issues

### Director Fails to Start

**Symptoms:**

   - Ensure execution policy allows script running (Windows)

2. **Network Access**
   - Verify internet connectivity for downloading components
   - Check corporate firewall for download restrictions
   - Consider manual download if automated download fails

3. **System Dependencies**
   - Install required runtime dependencies (.NET Core, Docker)
   - Update package managers (apt, yum, chocolatey)
   - Resolve any missing system libraries

**Windows PowerShell Execution Policy:**
```powershell
# Check current execution policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# Allow script execution (if required)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Data Processing Issues

2. **Network Connectivity Testing**
   - Test connection from source system to Director
   - Verify routing and firewall rules allow traffic
   - Use packet capture tools to confirm data transmission

3. **Director Input Configuration**
   - Review input configuration in Director settings
   - Verify enabled protocols and listening ports
   - Check for configuration syntax errors

4. **Log Analysis**
   - Examine Director logs for input processing errors
   - Check for data parsing or validation failures
   - Review error messages for specific issues

**Diagnostic Commands:**
```bash
# Test syslog connectivity
logger -n <director_ip> -P <port> "Test message"

# Check listening ports
netstat -tulpn | grep <director_ip>

# Monitor network traffic
tcpdump -i any port <port_number>
```
