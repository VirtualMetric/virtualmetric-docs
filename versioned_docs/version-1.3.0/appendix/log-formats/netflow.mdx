# NetFlow

A network protocol developed by Cisco for collecting, analyzing, and monitoring network traffic. It captures metadata about IP traffic flows, providing insights into bandwidth usage, security threats, and network performance. NetFlow records include key details such as source and destination IPs, ports, protocol types, and timestamps.
