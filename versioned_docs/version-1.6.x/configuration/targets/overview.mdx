# Targets: Overview

**Director** uses _targets_ as the output destinations to forward, store, and analyze collected telemetry data. Targets provide flexible options for data persistence and integration with various analysis platforms.

## Definitions

Targets serve as the endpoint destinations for processed data within the **Director** system. They operate on the following principles:

1. **Output Configuration**: Targets define where and how data should be delivered after processing.
2. **Format Adaptation**: They handle the conversion of internal data structures to destination-specific formats.
3. **Delivery Management**: Targets manage connection pooling, batching, and retry mechanisms.
4. **Destination Integration**: They provide authentication and protocol-specific features for various systems.

:::note
Targets enable:

> **Persistence**: Local and remote storage with various retention options.\
> **Integration**: Seamless connection to analytics platforms and messaging systems.

They also support _data transformation_, and _delivery confirmation_.
:::

## Configuration

All targets share the following base configuration fields:

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`name`|Y||Unique identifier for the target|
|`description`|N||Optional explanation|
|`type`|Y||Target type|
|`status`|N|`true`|Enable/disable the target|
|`batch_size`|N|`1000`|Records per batch|

:::tip
Each target type provides specific configuration options detailed in their respective sections.
:::

Use the `name` of the target to refer to it in your configurations.

**Example**:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: elasticsearch
    type: elasticsearch
    properties:
      hosts: ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]
      index: "logs-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
      username: "elastic"
      password: "${PASSWORD}"
```

The target listed here is of type `elasticsearch`. It specifies the _host_ that it will forward the data to and the _index_ on the host to which the data will be appended. To access the host, it specifies a _username_ and a _password_.

:::tip
You can use environment variables like `${PASSWORD}` for your credentials. This will improve security by removing the credentials from your configuration file.
:::

## Debug Options

Targets support debug configuration options for testing, troubleshooting, and development purposes. These options allow you to inspect data flow without affecting production systems.

### Configuration

Debug options are configured under the `debug` property within target properties:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: test_elastic
    type: elastic
    properties:
      index: "test-logs"
      endpoints:
        - endpoint: "http://elasticsearch:9200"
      debug:
        status: true
        dont_send_logs: false
```

### Debug Fields

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`debug.status`|N|`false`|Enable debug logging for the target|
|`debug.dont_send_logs`|N|`false`|Prevent logs from being sent to the actual target|

### Debug Status

When `debug.status` is set to `true`, the target logs each event to the internal debugger before processing. This provides visibility into:

- Message content being sent
- Device information (ID, name, type)
- Target type and operation details
- Timing and sequence of events

Debug logs are written to the system's debug output and can be used to:

- Verify data transformation and formatting
- Troubleshoot pipeline processing issues
- Monitor data flow in development environments
- Audit message content during testing

### Don't Send Logs

When `debug.dont_send_logs` is set to `true`, events are logged to the debugger but **not** sent to the actual target destination. This is useful for:

- **Safe Testing**: Test configuration changes without affecting production systems
- **Development**: Develop and validate pipelines without external dependencies
- **Cost Control**: Avoid charges from cloud services during testing
- **Dry Runs**: Verify event formatting and routing logic before deployment

:::warning
The `dont_send_logs` option only works when `debug.status` is also set to `true`. If debugging is disabled, logs will be sent normally regardless of the `dont_send_logs` setting.
:::

### Use Cases

#### Development Environment

Test your configuration safely without sending data to production targets:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: dev_splunk
    type: splunk
    properties:
      endpoints:
        - endpoint: "https://splunk.example.com:8088/services/collector"
          token: "YOUR-TOKEN"
      index: "main"
      debug:
        status: true
        dont_send_logs: true
```

#### Troubleshooting

Enable debug logging to diagnose issues while still sending data:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: debug_elastic
    type: elastic
    properties:
      index: "production-logs"
      endpoints:
        - endpoint: "http://elasticsearch:9200"
      debug:
        status: true
        dont_send_logs: false
```

#### Pipeline Validation

Verify pipeline transformations before enabling the target:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: validate_transformations
    type: splunk
    properties:
      endpoints:
        - endpoint: "https://splunk.example.com:8088/services/collector"
          token: "YOUR-TOKEN"
      field_format: "cim"
      debug:
        status: true
        dont_send_logs: true
    pipelines:
      - name: test_pipeline
        processors:
          - set:
              field: environment
              value: "development"
```

#### Staged Deployment

Test new target configurations in parallel with existing ones:

```yaml
targets:
  # Production target (normal operation)
  - name: prod_elastic
    type: elastic
    properties:
      index: "production-logs"
      endpoints:
        - endpoint: "http://prod-elasticsearch:9200"
  
  # Test target (debug mode, no actual sending)
  - name: test_elastic
    type: elastic
    properties:
      index: "test-logs"
      endpoints:
        - endpoint: "http://test-elasticsearch:9200"
      debug:
        status: true
        dont_send_logs: true
```

### Best Practices

**Disable in Production**: Always disable debug options in production environments to avoid performance overhead and excessive logging.

**Use for Development**: Enable `dont_send_logs` during development to prevent test data from reaching production systems.

**Temporary Troubleshooting**: Enable debug logging temporarily when investigating issues, then disable it once resolved.

**Separate Configurations**: Maintain separate configuration files for development and production environments with appropriate debug settings.

**Monitor Debug Output**: Ensure your logging system can handle the increased volume when debug logging is enabled.

### Performance Considerations

Debug logging adds overhead to target processing:

- Each event is serialized and written to the debug log
- Additional function calls and memory allocation occur
- Log I/O operations may impact throughput

For high-volume scenarios:
- Disable debug logging in production
- Use debug mode only for representative samples
- Monitor system resources when debugging is enabled

### Security Notes

Debug logs may contain sensitive information:

- Message content is logged verbatim
- Authentication tokens are not logged, but message content might contain PII
- Ensure debug logs are secured with appropriate access controls
- Review debug output before sharing for troubleshooting

## Deployment

The following deployment types can be used:

* **One-to-many** - data from a single source is routed to one or more destinations:

  > Syslog → Local Storage + Analysis Platform

* **Many-to-one** - data from multiple sources is routed to one destination:

  > Syslog + Windows → Local Storage

* **Many-to-many** - data from multiple sources is routed to multiple destinations:

  > Syslog + Windows → Local Storage
  >
  > Syslog + Elasticsearch → Cloud Upload + Analysis Platform

* **Chained** - data is routed sequentially from one destination to the next:

  > Syslog → Local Storage → Analysis Platform

Multiple targets can be used for redundancy, <Topic id="pipelines-normalization">normalization</Topic> rules can be implemented, and alerts can be put in place for notification and error handling.

## Target Types

Targets can be categorized into several functional types that serve different data management needs:

* **Analytical** - These targets integrate with platforms designed for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data:
  * Elasticsearch, Splunk, and other search and analytics engines
  
* **Storage-Based** - These targets focus on data persistence with various retention strategies:
  * Local files, S3 and other cloud storage services
  
* **Messaging** - These targets publish data to distributed messaging systems:
  * Kafka, RabbitMQ, and other message brokers

* **Integration** - These targets connect with external systems through APIs:
  * Webhooks, REST endpoints, and custom integrations

## Use Cases

The most common uses of targets are:

* **Local analysis** - Debug logging, performance analysis, audit trails, and temporary storage.

* **Cloud integration** - Long-term storage, data warehousing, security analysis, and compliance monitoring.

* **Real-time analysis** - Live monitoring, alert generation, trend analysis, and performance tracking.

* **Data lake building** - Raw data storage, schema evolution, data partitioning, and analytics preparation.

To serve these ends, the following _processing options_ are available:

* **Pipelines** - Field normalization (for ECS, CIM, ASIM, CEF, LEEF, and CSL), data transformation, message batching, custom field mapping, schema validation, and format conversion.

* **Buffer management** - Configurable buffer sizes, batch processing, flush intervals, queue management, checkpoint recovery, and error handling.

* **Performance** - Asynchronous writing, buffer optimization, connection pooling, retry mechanisms, resource monitoring, and size-based rotation.

* **Security** - Authentication using API keys, service principals, and client certificates. Encryption with TLS/SSL, HTTPS, or custom algorithms. Also, access control and audit logging.

## Implementation Strategies

### Storage Types

#### Local

**Director** supports the following local data output methods:

* **Console** - Direct _stdout_ writing with real-time message viewing. Also provides debugging and testing capability, format normalization, and synchronous writing with mutex locking

* **Files** - Multiple file formats are supported:
  * `json` - Each log entry is written as a separate JSON line (JSONL format)
  * `multijson` - All log entries are written as a single JSON array
  * `avro` - Apache Avro format with schema
  * `parquet` - Apache Parquet columnar format with schema
  
  Compression options like ZSTD, GZIP, Snappy, Brotli, and LZ4 are also supported. Additional features include dynamic file naming, size-based rotation, buffer management, and schema validation.

#### Cloud

The integration options for the cloud are below:

* **Azure Blob** - Direct blob writing and multiple containers are supported. Available authentication methods are service principal and managed Identity. Other features include automatic retries, exponential backoff, size-based chunking, connection pooling, and buffer management.

* **Microsoft Sentinel** - Direct DCR integration and ASIM normalization are supported. In addition to standard tables, _WindowsEvent_, _SecurityEvent_, _CommonSecurityLog_, and _Syslog_ can be used. Various ASIM tables are also available. (See the <Topic id="appendix-asim">ASIM section</Topic> for a complete list.)

### Redundant Delivery

For critical data flows, implement redundant delivery patterns:

* Primary and backup targets for important data
* Multi-region storage for disaster recovery
* Disk buffer with forward-on-recovery capability

### Routing Optimization

Configure intelligent routing based on data characteristics:

* Route high-volume data to scalable storage targets
* Send critical alerts to real-time notification endpoints
* Direct compliance data to specialized archival systems
