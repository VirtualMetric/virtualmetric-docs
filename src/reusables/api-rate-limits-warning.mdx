:::caution API Rate Limits
External services have rate limits that can affect processing:

- **VirusTotal**: 4 requests/minute (free), 1000 requests/minute (premium)
- **AlienVault OTX**: 1000 requests/hour (free), higher limits for paid plans
- **IP Quality Score**: Varies by plan, monitor quota usage
- **OpenAI/Anthropic**: Token-based limits, costs vary by model
- **Azure Services**: Request limits vary by service tier

Implement caching, batching, and error handling to manage rate limits effectively. Monitor API usage and implement alerts before reaching quotas.
