:::tip Cost Optimization
To minimize operational costs in production:

- Implement intelligent sampling for high-volume sources
- Use compression and efficient file formats (Parquet, Avro)
- Configure appropriate data retention policies
- Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting
- Use caching strategies to reduce external service calls
- Consider data tiering (hot, warm, cold storage)
- Regularly review and optimize pipeline efficiency
