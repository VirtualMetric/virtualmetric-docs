:::note Important
Before a pipeline is removed, its dependency relations must be resolved. If a pipeline

- is referenced by routes or other pipelines (as a child)
- has devices or targets attached to it

deletion is blocked and a modal window appears, displaying the dependencies which must either remove or be removed from the pipeline.
