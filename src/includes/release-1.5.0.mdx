## :rocket: New Features

- **Self Managed Director** - Two configuration management modes provide flexibility for different operational requirements. Managed Mode maintains automatic connection between platform and Director, pushing configuration changes in real-time for simplified operations. Self-Managed Mode enables administrators to download configurations from the platform and upload manually to Directors, providing enhanced control over configuration deployment. System displays warnings when new configurations are available but not yet applied, ensuring visibility into configuration status. Directors continue sending health status and statistics automatically in both modes, maintaining operational visibility while supporting diverse security policies and environment requirements.

- **Linux Agent** - Comprehensive monitoring capabilities for Linux systems enable collection of system logs, application logs, and audit data from Linux infrastructure. Two deployment modes support different operational approaches: Agent Mode provides direct installation and configuration control on individual systems, while Agentless Mode enables remote deployment across multiple Linux machines without manual installation requirements. This dual-mode architecture ensures flexible Linux environment monitoring tailored to operational requirements and infrastructure configurations.

### New Targets

- **Splunk** - Splunk HEC (HTTP Event Collector) target enables direct data transmission to Splunk infrastructure. Integration intelligently preserves structured fields when recognized, or ingests as raw data when unrecognized, ensuring comprehensive data forwarding. Seamless integration with existing Splunk deployments expands data routing options for analytics and monitoring workflows.

## :bug: Bug Fixes

- Fixed IP address display issue for agents where addresses were not showing correctly in the interface. Agent IP addresses now properly display, improving system visibility and identification.

- Resolved Quick Routes issue where newly added device types were not appearing in the device list. All device types now correctly display in Quick Routes interface, ensuring complete device visibility.

- Fixed User Management issue where password reset button was missing when SSO was disabled. Password reset functionality now properly accessible in non-SSO mode.
