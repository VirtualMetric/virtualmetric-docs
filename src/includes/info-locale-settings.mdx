Pick the locale that matches your audience's language and regional conventions (e.g., decimal separators, currency symbols, paper size).

Locale does not influence the system clock; Daylight Saving Time (DST) adjustments are handled by your chosen **timezone** instead.

When collaborating internationally, agree on a common locale for shared reports to avoid misinterpreting numbers and dates.
