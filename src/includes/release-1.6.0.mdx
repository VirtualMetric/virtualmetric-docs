## :rocket: New Features

- **Pipeline Updates** - Comprehensive update notification and review system for Content Hub pipelines. When updates are detected for downloaded pipelines, users receive automatic notifications about available improvements. Side-by-side comparison view displays both current and updated pipeline versions, allowing detailed review of proposed changes before implementation. Users maintain full control over update acceptance, choosing which modifications to apply based on operational requirements and configuration preferences.

- **Sub-Tenant Access Control with Approval Workflow** - Parent tenants now require explicit permission to access sub-tenant resources, ensuring enhanced security and access transparency across organizational hierarchies. Access requests can be submitted for individual modules, providing granular control over resource visibility and management capabilities. Sub-tenants review and approve requests through dedicated permission management interface, maintaining full authority over resource access and supporting principle of least privilege.

- **Log Usage Limit Control** - Platform tracks log consumption against allocated limits and displays persistent usage alerts in the interface. Visible warnings appear when log usage approaches or exceeds defined limits, with alerts remaining displayed at the top of the page until addressed for continuous visibility into resource utilization.

## :wrench: Improvements

### Component Enhancements

- **Linux Agent Event Collection Enhancement** - Linux monitoring capabilities expanded with audit event and firewall event collection options. Configure Linux agents to collect audit logs and firewall logs in addition to system and application logs, providing comprehensive visibility into security events and network activity across Linux infrastructure.

- **Import DCR Option** - Enhanced Windows device configuration with automatic DCR (Data Collection Rule) to XML conversion capability for Security Events and Event Logs custom options. This conversion feature streamlines configuration management by translating DCR configurations into XML format, improving compatibility and simplifying event collection setup.

- **Advanced Route Director Filtering** - Director-specific deployment control added to Advanced Routes, enabling targeted configuration distribution across infrastructure. Select specific Directors to receive Advanced Route configurations, with deployments limited only to the selected Directors. When no Directors are explicitly selected, the system maintains default behavior by deploying configurations to all available Directors, supporting staged rollouts and environment-specific routing.

- **Advanced Route Scheduling** - Time-based execution control added to Advanced Routes, enabling automated periodic processing based on defined schedules. Configure Advanced Routes to run automatically using either cron expressions for precise scheduling or interval-based timing for regular periodic execution. Supports batch processing workflows, off-peak data processing, and automated routine operations without manual intervention.

- **Windows DNS Logs Filtering** - Comprehensive filtering capabilities added for Windows DNS Logs, enabling precise log collection control through include and exclude filters. Configure DNS log collection using multiple filter criteria including Event ID, Response Code, Question Type, Device IP Address, Source IP, Destination IP, and Question Name filters. Reduces unnecessary log volume while maintaining visibility into critical DNS activity.

- **Content Hub Pipeline Template Expansion** - New pipeline templates added to Content Hub, providing additional pre-configured processing options for common use cases. Ready-to-use templates accelerate pipeline deployment and simplify configuration for standard data processing scenarios.

- **Target Execution Tab** - New Execution tab added to all target configurations, providing centralized control over target-specific operational settings. Configure scheduling operations directly within the target interface for automated execution based on defined schedules. Enable debug mode at the target level for troubleshooting and detailed execution visibility. This enhancement consolidates execution controls in a dedicated interface, supporting both automated workflows and diagnostic operations.

## :bug: Bug Fixes

### Configuration Persistence

- **Pipeline Update Display** - Fixed issue where pipeline changes were not immediately reflected in the interface after applying updates. Pipeline modifications now properly display, ensuring accurate visibility of current configurations.

- **Windows Event Log XML Queries** - Fixed issue where custom XML queries for Windows Event Log were not being saved correctly. Custom XML configurations now persist properly, ensuring reliable event collection based on user-defined XML queries.

- **Pre-processing Pipeline Selection** - Fixed issue preventing proper editing of pre-processing pipeline selections in Linux and Windows device log type configurations. Pipeline selection changes now save correctly, ensuring accurate log processing configuration.

### User Interface

- **Advanced Route Table Actions** - Fixed missing enable/disable action in Advanced Route table actions. Users can now properly enable or disable Advanced Routes directly from the table interface, improving route management accessibility.

- **Quick Route Pipeline Search** - Fixed search functionality in Quick Route pipeline selection. Pipeline search now works correctly, making it easier to locate and select pipelines when configuring Quick Routes.

- **Firefox Browser Compatibility** - Fixed issue where Advanced Route edit functionality was not displaying correctly in Firefox browsers. Advanced Route editing now works properly across all supported browsers, ensuring consistent user experience.

- **Sub-Tenant Email Links** - Fixed incorrect link redirection in email sent to sub-tenant owners upon tenant creation. Email links now direct sub-tenant owners to the correct login page, ensuring smooth onboarding experience.

- **User Preferences Date & Time Format** - Fixed issue where date & time format selection under user preferences could not be loaded properly, redirecting users to an error page. Date format preferences now load correctly, ensuring smooth user preference management.
