This release introduces major enterprise-focused features, along with important improvements in content management. With **Single Sign-On**, **RBAC**, and the first phase of the **MSSP** module, our platform becomes more secure, flexible, and enterprise-ready than ever before. We've also added more vendors to the **Content Hub** and introduced **Auto Syslog Discovery** to simplify log management.

## :rocket: New Features

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Authentication method allowing users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials, integrated with Microsoft Azure AD for enhanced security, reduced password fatigue, and centralized access management

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Fine-grained access management system with predefined roles (Admin, Contributor, User) and customizable roles for Enterprise plan users, providing structured access control and scalable permission management

- **MSSP Support (Phase 1)** - Managed Security Service Provider module enabling Enterprise-level customers to manage multiple tenants under a single account, offering centralized tenant management, quick switching between tenants, and enhanced operational efficiency with usage visibility and control

## :wrench: Improvements

- **More Vendors Added** - We expanded the list of supported vendors, giving customers access to a wider range of parser packs out of the box. Added support for **Barracuda**, **Infoblox**, **VirtualMetric** vendors and _Syslog_ target in **Content Hub**

- **Auto Syslog Discovery** - Automatically identifies the source behind each syslog message, ensuring clean and normalized logs without manual effort.

- Added **Active Directory** checkbox functionality for agentless device access - when **Active Directory** checkbox is enabled, the system attempts to connect using the AD user credentials from the server

- Added edit functionality for syslog forwarding addresses, eliminating the need to remove and re-add entries for updates

- Added enable/disable functionality to _Windows_ device detail pages

- Added filtering functionality for targets and vendors after device type selection in **Content Hub**

- Made _Sentinel_ target rows editable after adding stream configuration
