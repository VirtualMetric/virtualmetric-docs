## :wrench: Improvements

### Get More from Content Hub
- **More Vendors Added** - We expanded the list of supported vendors, giving customers access to a wider range of parser packs out of the box. Added support for **Barracuda**, **Infoblox**, **VirtualMetric** vendors and _Syslog_ target in **Content Hub**
- **Auto Syslog Discovery** - Automatically identifies the source behind each syslog message, ensuring clean and normalized logs without manual effort.
- Added filtering functionality for targets and vendors after device type selection in **Content Hub**

### Streamlined Device Configuration  
- Added **Active Directory** checkbox functionality for agentless device access - when **Active Directory** checkbox is enabled, the system attempts to connect using the AD user credentials from the server
- Added edit functionality for syslog forwarding addresses, eliminating the need to remove and re-add entries for updates
- Added enable/disable functionality to _Windows_ device detail pages
- Made _Sentinel_ target rows editable after adding stream configuration
