## :rocket: New Features

- **Settings** - Comprehensive Settings menu centralizes all important configurations and information. Manage team members, toggle SSO (Single Sign-On) authentication with a single click, and view detailed package information. Access and update company information from one convenient location for streamlined administrative tasks and better workspace control.

- **Microsoft Stats** - New statistics dashboard helps monitor and optimize data flow. Track the volume of data collected from sources and the amount transmitted to destinations in real-time. Dashboard displays data reduction metrics, showing how efficiently data is being optimized before transmission for informed decisions about resource allocation and optimization opportunities.

- **Usage and Limit** - Users can now view their usage and package details through the **Usage and Limit** screen where they can track usage trends over specific time periods and analyze data across main and sub-tenants using the tenant filter. This enhancement improves visibility and control over resource consumption, helping users manage their limits more effectively.

### New Devices

- **Azure Blob Storage** - Collect and process log data stored in scalable Azure Blob Storage object containers. Seamlessly ingest data from Azure Blob Storage accounts and route it to preferred destinations.

- **Azure Event Hubs** - Ingest and process large volumes of log and event data in real-time. This integration enables high-throughput data collection from Azure infrastructure.

### New Targets

- **Microsoft Sentinel data lake** - Route data to **Microsoft Sentinel** data lake for long-term security analysis and large-scale investigations. Preserves both structured and raw data for comprehensive forensic analysis.

- **Elasticsearch** - Index data into Elasticsearch for powerful search and analytics. Structured fields are stored for efficient searching, while unstructured data is preserved to maintain all information for comprehensive log analysis.

- **Azure Event Hubs** - Stream data to Azure Event Hubs for large-scale event processing and integration. Structured fields are transmitted, or raw data is forwarded if unrecognized, enabling real-time data pipelines and downstream processing.

## :wrench: Improvements

### Device and Target Enhancements

- **Windows Log Type Pipeline Selection** - Optional pre-processing pipeline selection for Windows devices provides greater control over Windows log processing. Choose specific pipelines to transform and enrich data before it reaches its destination, enabling customized data processing workflows tailored to security and operational needs.

- **Windows New Log Types** - Windows devices now support additional log types including Event Logs and Firewall Logs with both Basic and Custom configuration options. Event Logs provide comprehensive system, security, and application event data, while Firewall Logs capture network traffic and security events, enhancing visibility into Windows infrastructure and strengthening security monitoring capabilities.

- **Director Proxy Fields** - Added proxy fields to Azure Data Explorer, Microsoft Sentinel, and Azure Blob Storage targets for enhanced metadata tracking. These fields provide additional context about data routing and processing through the Director component, enabling better traceability and debugging of data pipelines across multiple Azure destinations.

- **Target Deletion Protection** - Enhanced target deletion controls prevent accidental removal of targets in use. If a target is selected in an advanced route configuration, the system now blocks its deletion, protecting data pipelines from unintended disruptions and ensuring configuration integrity.

### User Interface

- **Sticky Button Areas** - In the **Quick Routes** view, **Add** and **Cancel** buttons are now fixed in place when working with long device and target lists. Makes it easier to perform actions without scrolling, enhancing user experience and reducing clicks when managing multiple sources and destinations.

- **Content Hub License Tab** - **New License** tab added to Content Hub for better visibility into content licensing information. Users can easily view and understand license terms associated with each content package before installation, ensuring compliance and informed decision-making.

## :bug: Bug Fixes

### Content Management

- **Content Download Pipeline Naming** - Fixed issue where child pipelines were incorrectly created with "clone" suffixes when downloading content, resolving potential name matching problems and ensuring proper pipeline identification across configurations.

- **Content Hub Dependent Content Display** - Resolved bug that limited display of dependent content to maximum of 15 items in Content Hub. System now correctly shows all dependent content packages, providing complete visibility into content dependencies.

### Configuration Persistence

- **Target Configuration Saving** - Fixed bug where configuration changes were not being saved when adding or editing targets. Target configurations now properly persist, ensuring settings are correctly applied and maintained.

- **Pipeline Configuration Updates** - Resolved issue where pipeline configurations were not updating correctly after modifications. Pipeline updates now properly save and apply configuration changes, maintaining consistency across data processing workflows.

- **Advanced Route Target Selection** - Fixed bug where target selections in Advanced Route configurations were not being saved after selection. Target choices now correctly persist, ensuring routing rules are properly configured and executed.

- **Child Pipeline Deletion** - Resolved bug where child pipelines were not properly removed during "delete entire pipeline" operations. System now correctly cleans up all associated child pipelines, preventing orphaned configurations and maintaining a clean workspace.
