# Audit

The **Audit** dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and tracking capabilities for all user activities within the **DataStream** platform. This security-focused interface enables administrators to monitor user actions, track system changes, and maintain detailed logs for compliance, security analysis, and operational oversight.

## Audit Dashboard Overview

The main audit dashboard displays a chronological record of all system activities with the following essential components:

- **Filter**: Advanced filtering options to narrow down audit records by various criteria
- **Search bar**: Real-time search functionality to find specific users or actions
- **Audit table**: Comprehensive log display with User, User IP, Object type, Object, Action, Action Description, and Date columns
- **Pagination controls**: Navigate through historical audit records with configurable items per page
- **Refresh button**: Update the audit log display with the latest activities

### Audit Log Columns

The audit table provides detailed information for each recorded activity:

#### User Information

- **User**: Email address of the user who performed the action (e.g., john.doe@virtualmetric.com)
- **User IP**: Source IP address from which the action was initiated (e.g., 31.223.64.72, 5.25.48.20, 176.239.251.217)

#### Action Details

- **Object type**: Category of the system component affected (User, ContentHub, Pipeline)
- **Object**: Specific target of the action (user email, content name, pipeline identifier)
- **Action**: Type of operation performed (CreateUser, DeleteUser, UpdateUser, LoginSuccess, LoginFailed, InstalledContentHub, CreatedPipeline)
- **Action Description**: Human-readable explanation of what occurred
- **Date**: Precise timestamp of when the action took place

### Tracked Activities

The audit system captures various types of activities:

#### User Management Activities

- **CreateUser**: "A new user account was successfully created"
- **DeleteUser**: "User account was deleted"  
- **UpdateUser**: "User details were updated"

#### Authentication Events

- **LoginSuccess**: "User logged in successfully"
- **LoginFailed**: "Failed login attempt"

#### Content Management Activities

- **InstalledContentHub**: "A template was installed successfully" (e.g., Microsoft Sentinel Automation and Normalization Pack)

#### Pipeline Management Activities

- **CreatedPipeline**: "A new pipeline was created successfully"

## Search Functionality

Use the search feature to quickly locate specific audit records. The search functionality provides:

- **Real-time filtering**: Search results update as you type
- **Multi-field search**: Searches across user names, actions, and descriptions
- **Clear search**: X button to quickly clear the search criteria
- **Case-insensitive matching**: Finds results regardless of letter case

Searching for specific user accounts filters the audit log to show only activities related to that user, making it easy to track individual user behaviors and actions.

## Advanced Filtering

Apply sophisticated filters to analyze specific aspects of system activity with multiple filter criteria:

### Applied Filters Display

The active filters are shown as removable tags:

- **User**: Filter by specific user account
- **From/To dates**: Set start and end dates for the audit period
- **Object type**: Filter by object category
- **Object**: Filter by specific object target

### Filter Management

- **Modify button**: Edit existing filter criteria
- **Clear all button**: Remove all applied filters to return to full audit view
- **Filter persistence**: Applied filters remain active until manually removed

### Filter Results

When filters are applied, you can see focused results such as:

- User login sessions from different IP addresses
- Failed login attempts for security monitoring
- Successful authentication events with timestamps

The filtered view displays the narrowed results from the full audit log.

## Security and Compliance Benefits

### Security Monitoring

- **Failed Login Detection**: Identify potential unauthorized access attempts
- **IP Address Tracking**: Monitor access patterns and detect suspicious locations
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Track user behavior for security analysis
- **Real-time Alerting**: Immediate visibility into critical system changes

### Compliance Support

- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all system modifications
- **Time Stamping**: Precise documentation of when actions occurred
- **User Attribution**: Clear identification of who performed each action
- **Data Retention**: Historical records for regulatory compliance requirements

### Operational Insights

- **Usage Patterns**: Understand how users interact with the system
- **Change Tracking**: Monitor configuration modifications and system updates
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify peak usage times and system load patterns
- **Troubleshooting**: Historical context for investigating system issues

## Best Practices for Audit Management

### Regular Monitoring

- **Daily Reviews**: Check audit logs regularly for unusual activities
- **Filter Utilization**: Use filters to focus on specific time periods or user groups
- **Search Capabilities**: Leverage search functionality for incident investigation
- **Export Options**: Extract audit data for external analysis and reporting

### Security Analysis

- **Failed Login Monitoring**: Pay attention to multiple failed login attempts
- **IP Address Validation**: Verify that user access comes from expected locations
- **Time-based Analysis**: Look for unusual activity patterns outside normal business hours
- **Privilege Escalation**: Monitor for unexpected changes in user permissions

The audit dashboard serves as a critical component for maintaining security, ensuring compliance, and providing operational visibility across the entire **DataStream** platform.
