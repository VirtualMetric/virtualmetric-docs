# Creating Roles

The **DataStream** platform provides a comprehensive role-based access control system with three built-in roles designed to meet standard organizational security requirements. While the system comes with pre-configured roles (User, Admin, Owner), understanding the role creation principles helps administrators effectively manage access control.

## Role Creation Principles

### Permission Structure Design

When designing roles, consider the hierarchical permission structure that governs platform access:

#### Application-Level Permissions
- **APP_LEVEL.ROUTE**: Controls access to specific application routes and pages
- **FUNCTIONAL_AREA**: Defines access to major system components (FLEET_MANAGEMENT, PIPELINES, etc.)
- **SPECIFIC_ACTION**: Granular control over particular operations (PULL_DEVICES, TARGETS, etc.)
- **SUB_COMPONENT**: Fine-grained access to specific features (AZURE_BLOB_STORAGE, OPENBSD, etc.)

### Role Design Best Practices

#### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for users to perform their required tasks
- Start with read-only access and add edit/delete permissions only when justified
- Regularly review and audit role assignments to ensure continued appropriateness

#### Functional Area Organization
- **Fleet Management Permissions**: Control access to devices, targets, and directors
- **Pipeline Management**: Govern pipeline creation, modification, and monitoring
- **Route Management**: Manage data routing and flow control
- **User Management**: Administrative access to user accounts and role assignment
- **Audit Access**: Control visibility into system logs and audit trails

## Built-in Role Framework

### User Role Template (176 Permissions)
- **Read-only access** to all data and views
- **No edit or delete capabilities**
- **Ideal for**: Analysts, viewers, and standard users who need visibility without modification rights

### Admin Role Template (340 Permissions)
- **Full read, edit, and delete access** to most system components
- **User management capabilities**
- **Restricted from owner account modifications**
- **Ideal for**: System administrators and technical staff requiring comprehensive access

### Owner Role Template (340 Permissions)
- **Complete system access** including owner account management
- **Highest privilege level** with unrestricted capabilities
- **Ideal for**: System owners and primary administrators with full accountability

## Permission Categories

### Fleet Management Permissions
- Device pull operations for various operating systems (OpenBSD, NetBSD, etc.)
- Target management including Azure Blob Storage, file targets, and other destinations
- Director management and configuration

### Data Processing Permissions
- Pipeline creation, modification, and monitoring
- Route configuration for both quick and advanced routing scenarios
- Content hub access for solution management

### Administrative Permissions
- User account management and role assignment
- Audit log access and security monitoring
- System configuration and maintenance

## Role Assignment Considerations

### Security Guidelines
- **Owner roles** should be limited to essential personnel only
- **Admin roles** require careful vetting due to comprehensive access
- **User roles** provide safe access for most organizational needs
- **Regular audits** ensure role assignments remain appropriate over time

### Operational Efficiency
- Match role permissions to actual job responsibilities
- Consider workflow requirements when assigning access levels
- Balance security requirements with operational needs
- Document role assignments and their justification for compliance purposes
