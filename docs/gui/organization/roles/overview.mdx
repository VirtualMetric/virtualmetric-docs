# Roles: Overview

The **Roles Overview** provides administrators with comprehensive visibility into the role-based access control system within the **DataStream** platform. This interface displays all available roles, their permission levels, assignment counts, and provides detailed access control management for organizational security.

## Role Management Dashboard

The main roles view displays all available roles in your organization with their key characteristics. The view contains the following essential components:

- **Role table**: Displays Role name, Description, Permissions count, and Assigned Users count
- **Items per page**: Controls pagination settings for role display
- **Page navigation**: Shows current page and total pages
- **Action menu**: Three-dot menu for additional role management options

## Built-in Role Types

The system provides three fundamental role types with distinct permission levels:

### User Role

- **Description**: Users have read-only access to all files, with no access to edit/delete actions
- **Permissions**: 176 read-only permissions
- **Use Case**: Recommended for standard users who need to view data and views without modification capabilities

### Owner Role

- **Description**: Owner has the ability to read, edit and delete all files and make configurations
- **Permissions**: 340 comprehensive permissions
- **Use Case**: Highest privilege level for system owners and primary administrators

### Admin Role

- **Description**: Admin has the same abilities with owners to read, edit and delete all files and make configurations, cannot change owner information
- **Permissions**: 340 comprehensive permissions  
- **Use Case**: Full administrative access with restrictions on owner account modifications

## Role Assignment Tracking

The system provides real-time visibility into role assignments:

- **Real-time assignment counts**: Shows exact number of users per role
- **User identification**: Displays both email addresses and full names for assigned users
- **Assignment distribution**: Monitors role distribution across the organization
- **Permission utilization**: Tracks which permissions are actively assigned through roles

## Permission Structure

Each permission follows a hierarchical naming convention:

- **APP_LEVEL**: Application-level access control
- **ROUTE**: Specific route or page access
- **FUNCTIONAL_AREA**: System component (e.g., FLEET_MANAGEMENT)
- **SPECIFIC_ACTION**: Detailed permission scope (e.g., PULL_DEVICES, TARGETS)
- **SUB_COMPONENT**: Granular access control (e.g., OPENBSD, NETBSD, AZURE_BLOB_STORAGE)

This hierarchical structure ensures granular access control and allows for precise permission management across all platform components.
