# Managing Users

The **Manage Users** interface allows administrators to control user accounts, permissions, and access within the **DataStream** platform. This comprehensive user management system provides the ability to create, edit, disable, and monitor user accounts across your organization.

## User Overview

The main users view serves as the central hub for managing all registered users in your organization. This interface presents a comprehensive view of your user base with essential information organized in an intuitive layout.

The view provides several key management tools and displays user information in a structured format:

- **Search users**: A text input field positioned at the top of the interface allows you to quickly locate specific users by entering their name or email address
- **Status filter**: A dropdown menu enables filtering of users based on their current status (All, Active, or Passive)
- **Add new user**: A prominently displayed blue button provides quick access to the user creation workflow
- **User table**: A structured table displays essential user information including Full Name, Email, User Role, and current Status for each registered user
- **Items per page**: Pagination controls allow you to adjust how many users are displayed per page (10, 25, or 50 items)
- **Page navigation**: Navigation controls show the current page number and total pages available

This organized layout ensures efficient user management and quick access to essential user information across your organization.

## Adding New Users

Creating new user accounts is accomplished through a dedicated user creation form. Access this form by clicking the **Add new user** button from the main view. The form is organized into three main sections to ensure complete and accurate user setup.

### User Details Section

The user creation process begins with entering essential account information. All fields in this section are mandatory for successful account creation:

- **Full name**: Enter the complete name of the user as it should appear throughout the system
- **User email**: Provide a valid email address that will serve as the primary login credential for the account
- **Password**: Create a secure initial password that meets your organization's security requirements
- **Confirm password**: Re-enter the password exactly as entered above to verify accuracy and prevent typing errors

### Regional Settings

Customize the user experience by configuring regional preferences that affect how information is displayed and processed:

- **Timezone preference**: Select the appropriate timezone from a comprehensive dropdown menu that includes options such as GMT+03:00 Istanbul, Ankara, Ä°zmir, Bursa, Adana, ensuring proper time display for the user's location
- **Language**: Configure the interface language preference, with English set as the default option

### Role Assignment

Determine the level of access and permissions for the new user by selecting from the available role options:

- **User (Read only)**: This role grants read-only permissions, making it ideal for users who need to view data and views but should not make changes or deletions within the organization
- **Admin**: This role provides comprehensive edit and delete permissions, recommended for users who are authorized and responsible for making modifications across the organization

The role selection is crucial as it determines the scope of actions the user can perform within the platform. Admin users receive full access to configuration modifications and system management, while Read-only users are restricted to viewing data and utilizing views without modification capabilities.

Complete the user creation process by clicking **Add user** to finalize the account setup, or click **Cancel** to abandon the configuration and return to the main view.

## User Management Actions

### User Account Disabling

The system provides a secure method for temporarily restricting user access through the account disabling feature. When an administrator disables a user account, the system immediately provides feedback through a notification system.

Upon successful account disabling, a notification message appears stating "User disabled - User has successfully been disabled." This confirmation ensures that the administrative action was completed successfully.

Once disabled, user accounts are marked with a "Passive" status in the main user list, making it easy to identify accounts that cannot currently access the platform. Disabled users retain all their account data and settings but cannot log in or access any platform features until their account is reactivated by an administrator.

This disabling functionality is particularly useful for temporary access restrictions, such as when employees are on leave or when investigating security concerns.

### Account Management Options

For comprehensive user account management, the interface provides two primary account control options that administrators can use based on their specific needs:

- **Disable**: This option temporarily restricts user access while preserving all account data, settings, and historical information. Disabled accounts can be easily reactivated when needed, making this option ideal for temporary access restrictions.
- **Delete**: This option permanently removes the user account and all associated data from the system. Once deleted, account information cannot be recovered, making this option appropriate only when permanent account removal is required.

These options should be used carefully, with administrators considering the long-term implications of each action. The disable option is generally preferred when there's a possibility of future account reactivation.

## User Details and Permissions Management

Individual user management is accomplished through a comprehensive user details interface. Access this detailed view by clicking on any user from the main user list. This interface provides complete control over user settings, permissions, and account information.

### User Details Configuration

The user details section provides comprehensive control over individual account settings:

- **Full name**: An editable field allowing administrators to update the user's display name as needed for organizational changes
- **Role**: A changeable role assignment system allowing administrators to switch users between Admin and User (Read-only) permissions based on changing responsibilities
- **User email**: Displays the user's primary email address used for login credentials
- **Password**: Provides password management functionality including reset capabilities for security maintenance
- **Timezone preference**: Configurable timezone settings that can be adjusted based on user location changes or preferences
- **Language**: Interface language selection allowing administrators to set the most appropriate language for each user

### User Information and Activity Panel

The user information panel provides essential account status and activity details:

- **Status**: Displays the current operational status of the user account (Active or Passive)
- **Added on**: Shows the exact date and time when the user account was originally created, providing historical context
- **Last session details**: Presents information about the user's most recent login activity, including timestamp and session information
- **See all sessions**: Provides access to a comprehensive session history, allowing administrators to review user activity patterns and login behavior

This information panel is crucial for account monitoring and security oversight, enabling administrators to track user engagement and identify any unusual activity patterns.

### Password Management and Security

Password management is handled through a dedicated reset functionality accessible through the user details interface. The password reset feature provides administrators with the tools needed to maintain account security and resolve access issues.

The password management system allows administrators to:
- Generate new temporary passwords for users who have forgotten their credentials
- Force password changes on the user's next login attempt, ensuring security compliance
- Maintain proper account security through systematic password management procedures

This comprehensive password management approach ensures that user accounts remain secure while providing administrators with the flexibility to resolve access issues quickly and efficiently.

All changes made through the user details interface are saved using the **Save changes** button, or can be discarded using the **Cancel** option, providing administrators with full control over when modifications are applied.
