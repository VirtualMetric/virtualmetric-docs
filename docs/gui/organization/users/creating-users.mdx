# Creating Users

Creating new user accounts is accomplished through a dedicated user creation form. Access this form by clicking the **Add new user** button from the main users view. The form is organized into three main sections to ensure complete and accurate user setup.

## User Creation Workflow

### User Details Section

The user creation process begins with entering essential account information. All fields in this section are mandatory for successful account creation:

- **Full name**: Enter the complete name of the user as it should appear throughout the system
- **User email**: Provide a valid email address that will serve as the primary login credential for the account
- **Password**: Create a secure initial password that meets your organization's security requirements
- **Confirm password**: Re-enter the password exactly as entered above to verify accuracy and prevent typing errors

### Regional Settings

Customize the user experience by configuring regional preferences that affect how information is displayed and processed:

- **Timezone preference**: Select the appropriate timezone from a comprehensive dropdown menu that includes options such as GMT+03:00 Istanbul, Ankara, Ä°zmir, Bursa, Adana, ensuring proper time display for the user's location
- **Language**: Configure the interface language preference, with English set as the default option

### Role Assignment

Determine the level of access and permissions for the new user by selecting from the available role options:

- **User (Read only)**: This role grants read-only permissions, making it ideal for users who need to view data and views but should not make changes or deletions within the organization
- **Admin**: This role provides comprehensive edit and delete permissions, recommended for users who are authorized and responsible for making modifications across the organization
- **Owner**: The highest privilege level with full system access and ownership capabilities

The role selection is crucial as it determines the scope of actions the user can perform within the platform. Admin users receive full access to configuration modifications and system management, while Read-only users are restricted to viewing data and utilizing views without modification capabilities.

## Completing User Creation

Complete the user creation process by clicking **Add user** to finalize the account setup, or click **Cancel** to abandon the configuration and return to the main view.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Requirements**: Ensure initial passwords meet your organization's security standards
- **Role Assignment**: Carefully consider the appropriate access level for each user based on their responsibilities
- **Email Verification**: Verify that email addresses are accurate as they serve as primary login credentials
- **Regional Settings**: Proper timezone configuration ensures accurate timestamp display for audit and monitoring purposes
