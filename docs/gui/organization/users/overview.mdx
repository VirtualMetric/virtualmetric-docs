# Users Overview

The **Users Overview** provides administrators with a comprehensive view of all registered users within the **DataStream** platform. This central management interface serves as the primary dashboard for monitoring user accounts, their status, roles, and access patterns across your organization.

## User Management Dashboard

The main users view serves as the central hub for managing all registered users in your organization. This interface presents a comprehensive view of your user base with essential information organized in an intuitive layout.

The view provides several key management tools and displays user information in a structured format:

- **Search users**: A text input field positioned at the top of the interface allows you to quickly locate specific users by entering their name or email address
- **Status filter**: A dropdown menu enables filtering of users based on their current status (All, Active, or Passive)
- **Add new user**: A prominently displayed blue button provides quick access to the user creation workflow
- **User table**: A structured table displays essential user information including Full Name, Email, User Role, and current Status for each registered user
- **Items per page**: Pagination controls allow you to adjust how many users are displayed per page (10, 25, or 50 items)
- **Page navigation**: Navigation controls show the current page number and total pages available

This organized layout ensures efficient user management and quick access to essential user information across your organization.

## User Status Management

Users can exist in different states within the system:

- **Active**: Users who can log in and access the platform according to their assigned role permissions
- **Passive**: Users whose access has been temporarily disabled but whose accounts remain in the system

## User Role Assignment

Each user is assigned one of the three fundamental role types:

- **User (Read only)**: Read-only permissions, ideal for users who need to view data and views but should not make changes
- **Admin**: Comprehensive edit and delete permissions, recommended for users authorized to make modifications across the organization
- **Owner**: Highest privilege level with full system access and ownership capabilities

## Quick Actions

The interface provides immediate access to essential user management functions:

- **Create new accounts** through the streamlined user creation workflow
- **Search and filter** existing users for quick location and status assessment
- **Monitor user distribution** across different roles and status categories
- **Access detailed user information** for comprehensive account management
