To create a push device:

- In the **Home** view, click **Fleet Management**&nbsp;>&nbsp;**Devices**

-or-

- From the hamburger menu on the top left, select **Fleet Management**&nbsp;>&nbsp;**Devices**

Then, in the **Devices** view, click the card of your push device type (Syslog, HTTP, UDP, TCP, or eStreamer).
