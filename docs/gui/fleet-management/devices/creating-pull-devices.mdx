To create a pull device:

  -or-

- From the hamburger menu on the top left, select **Fleet Management**&nbsp;>&nbsp;**Devices**

  This takes you to the table view for devices, with the pull device you have clicked selected in blue on the left sidebar.

    ### Choose Setup Method for Device
    
    #### Define Device Details

    - **Name** (Required) - The name of your device. Must be unique.
    - **Director** (Required) - The director to attach the device to. Select from the dropdown.

    #### Choose Deployment Type

    There are two deployment types:

      - **Agent** - Installs a lightweight **Agent** that sets up the device in your environment.

        Selecting this changes the primary button label to **Create device**. Clicking the button takes you directly to the **Install and Connect** tab for Agent.

      - **Agentless** - Uses auto-detection to set up the device in your environment.

        Selecting this changes the primary button label to **Next step**. Clicking the button takes you to the **Install and Connect** tab for Agentless.

      ## Agent

      On this tab, we will find a box containing an API key and a script. You will use this to install **Agent**.

      <Include id="admin-for-installation-script" />

      - Open a terminal window with administrator privileges.
      - Copy the key and script above.
      - Paste them into the terminal.
      - Press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short> to run the script.

      This will take a few minutes to complete.

      :::info Important
      At this point, for the connection between the agent and the director to work, make sure that the default port `80` is open. If that port is being used for another purpose, then

      - Open the `vmetric.yml` file under `<vm_root>`
      - Change the `http_config_port` setting with the port number you want to dedicate to this connection
      :::

      To the right, you will see a **Verify connection** button. Clicking this button starts sending a request to check whether a **Agent** has been installed.

      Once the connection is verified, a **Connection successful** message is displayed.

      <Include id="connection-verification-failure" />

      If the connection is not verified, you can use the **Connect later** button to defer this step. The not-yet-enabled agent will still appear on the devices list.

      Clicking this button takes you to the **Review and Configure** tab.

      ### Configure Remote Access

      - **IP Address** - Enter the IP address of the target system
      - **Port** - Enter the port used for remote access
      - **Active Directory Authentication** - **AD** authentication settings

        When this option is disabled, three fields are displayed:

        - **Username** (Required) - **AD** username
        - **Password** (Required) - **AD** password
        - **Domain** (Optional) - **AD** domain

        The director will access the target system at the specified IP address using these credentials to validate remote access and permissions. No agent is deployed in this method.

        When enabled, authentication is handled automatically by **DataStream** with your organizationâ€™s credentials.

      The **Check Access** button verifies that the authentication credentials are valid.

      Clicking the blue **Create Device** button takes you to the **Review and Configure** tab.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="review-and-configure" label="Review and Configure">
    This is an optional tab.

    ### Select Log Types

    - **Windows Security Events** - Enable/disable log collection. Used to select what type of data will be collected. There are three choices:

      - **All** - Collects all **Windows** security and **AppLocker** event. The most comprehensive option.
      - **Common** - Collects the standard event set for audit purposes. Sufficient for general security monitoring.
      - **Minimal** - Collects a small subset of events that may reveal potential threats.
      - **Custom** - The user specifies their own filters using XML-based filter definitions.
