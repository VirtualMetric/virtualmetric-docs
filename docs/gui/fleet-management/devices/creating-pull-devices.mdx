:::

This takes you to the configuration view of the selected pull device type.

To create a new device, click the blue **Add new device** button on the top right.

This takes you to the configuration view.

## Choose Setup Method for Device

This tab contains the following sections:

### Define Device Details

- **Name** (Required) - The name of your device. Must be unique
- **Director** (Required) - The director that the device will be attached to. Pick one from the dropdown

### Choose Deployment Type

There are two deployment types:

  - **Agent**
  - **Agentless**

See below for the details of each card.

---

### Agent

Installs a lightweight **Agent** that sets up the device in your environment.

Selecting this turns the blue button to **Create device**. Clicking the button takes you to the [**Install and Connect**](#install-and-connect) tab.

On this tab, we will find a box containing an API key and a script. You will use this to install **Agent**.

<Include id="admin-for-installation-script" />

- Open a terminal window with admin access
- Copy the above-mentioned key and script
- Paste it in the prompt
- Press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short> to start running the script

This will take a few minutes to complete.

To the right, you will see a **Verify connection** button. Clicking this button starts sending a request to check whether a **Agent** has been installed.

Once the connection is verified, you will be prompted with a **Connection succesful** message.

<Include id="connection-verification-failure" />

If the connection is not verified, you can use the **Connect Later** button to defer this installation step. However, the not-yet-enabled agent will still appear on the agents list.

Clicking this button takes you to the [**Next step**](#view-and-configure).

### Agentless

Uses autodetect to set up the device in your environment. Selecting this requires you to go to the [**Next step**](#setup-device) with the blue button.

## View and Configure

This optional step's view has the following section.

#### Select Log Types

- **Windows Security Events** - Enable/disable log collection. Used to select what type of data will be collected. There are three choices:

  - **All** - Collects all **Windows** security and **AppLocker** event. The most comprehensive option
  - **Common** - Collects the standard event set for audit purposes. Sufficient for general security monitorin
  - **Minimal** - Collects a small subset of events that may reveal potential threats
  - **Custom** - The user specifies their own filters using XML-based filter definitions.

## Connect Agentless

This view has the following tabs:

### Setup Device

### Install and Connect

This tab contains the following section:

#### Configure Remote Access

- **IP Address** - Enter an IP address for the agent to use
- **Port** - Enter a port number for the agent to use
- **Active Directory Authentication** - **AD** authentication settings.

  When disabled, three fields are displayed:

  - **Username** (Required) - **AD** username
  - **Password** (Required) - **AD** password
  - **Domain** (Optional) - **AD** domain

  Your director will access the IP address specified above with these account credentials to install an agent. The account must have the privileges to install agents on that domain server.

  When enabled, authentication is handled automatically by **DataStream** with the user's organiation credentials.

The **Check access** button verifies that the authentication credentials are valid.
