# Devices: Overview

This is where you manage all your data ingestion devices.

The main view shows devices organized into two categories:

- **Push Devices** - Network endpoints that receive incoming data (Syslog, HTTP, UDP, TCP, eStreamer)
- **Pull Devices** - Local agents that collect data from systems (Windows Agent)

## Device Categories

**Push Devices** listen on specified ports and receive data from external sources. Each category shows enabled/disabled counters.

**Pull Devices** are agents installed on target systems to collect logs locally. These require agent installation and show connection status.

## Interface

The sidebar on the left categorizes device types with:

- **Device type names** with enabled/disabled counts
- **Quick navigation** to each device category
- **Visual status indicators** for operational states

The main area contains:

- **Create device** button at the top right
- **Device list table** showing all devices of the selected type
- **Search devices** text box to filter by name
- **Status filter** dropdown to filter by operational state
- **Actions menu** (&#x22EE;) for each device with edit, enable/disable, and delete options
