# Devices: Overview

This is where you configure and manage all your data ingestion devices.

The view contains the following elements:

- **Search box** - A text box where you can type the name of the device you are looking for.

- **Push** - The cards for network endpoints that receive incoming data (e.g., Syslog, HTTP, UDP, TCP, or eStreamer). These listen on specified ports and receive data from external sources. Each category shows enabled/disabled counters.

Currently available push devices:

- <Topic id="devices-syslog">**Syslog**</Topic> devices receive system logs and events from network devices, servers, and applications using the standard syslog protocol.

- <Topic id="devices-http">**HTTP**</Topic> devices accept data submissions through HTTP/HTTPS endpoints for web-based log collection and API integrations.

- <Topic id="devices-udp">**UDP**</Topic> devices listen for connectionless data transmissions over UDP protocol for high-throughput, low-latency log ingestion.

- <Topic id="devices-tcp">**TCP**</Topic> devices establish reliable connection-based data streams over TCP protocol for guaranteed data delivery.

- <Topic id="devices-estreamer">**eStreamer**</Topic> devices integrate with Cisco security appliances to receive real-time event data and security intelligence feeds.

- **Pull** - The cards for local agents that communicate with **Director** to propagate ingestion logic (for example, a _Windows_ device). These are installed on target systems to collect logs locally. They require an **Agent** installation and a valid, active connection to run.

Currently available pull devices:

- <Topic id="devices-windows">**Windows**</Topic> devices deploy local agents on Windows systems to collect logs, events, and performance metrics directly from the operating system.

The three buttons on the left; **All**, **Push**, and **Pull**  can also be used to filter device types, along with displaying the total number in each category.

The cards also display the number of devices of that type that have been _enabled_ and _disabled_ on your **DataStream** environment.
