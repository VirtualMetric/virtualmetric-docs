# Devices: Overview

The Devices Dashboard is your central management interface for configuring and monitoring all data ingestion sources in your VirtualMetric DataStream environment. This interface provides comprehensive device management capabilities for both Push devices (which receive data) and Pull devices (Agents that collect data from local systems).

## Device Categories

### Push Devices

Push devices are network-accessible endpoints that receive incoming log data from external sources. These devices listen on specified ports and protocols, providing centralized data collection points for your infrastructure.

**Available Push Device Types:**

- **Syslog**: Standard protocol for collecting and forwarding log messages from various devices to a centralized server
- **HTTP**: Enables log data ingestion through HTTP protocol for efficient data transmission
- **UDP**: Allows log data collection using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for faster but less reliable transmission
- **TCP**: Collects logs using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for reliable and ordered data delivery
- **eStreamer**: A protocol designed for retrieving detailed event and log data from network and security devices

Each Push device category displays enabled/disabled status counters, allowing you to quickly assess your device configuration state and operational readiness.

### Pull Devices (Agents)

Pull devices are lightweight agents installed on target systems to collect logs locally. These agents actively gather data from the systems they're installed on, providing comprehensive local system monitoring.

**Available Pull Device Types:**

- **Windows**: The Windows agent collects logs from Windows systems including event logs, performance data, and security information
- **Linux**: Linux agent support (marked as "Coming Soon" in current interface)

Pull devices require agent installation and display connection status to help you monitor agent health and connectivity with the DataStream infrastructure.

## Dashboard Interface

### Main Dashboard Features

The main dashboard displays devices organized into distinct categories with comprehensive management capabilities:

- **Device Type Organization**: Clear categorization between Push and Pull devices for efficient management
- **Status Indicators**: Visual representation of device operational states and connectivity
- **Quick Access**: Direct navigation to specific device types and configurations
- **Count Displays**: Real-time counters showing enabled/disabled devices per category
- **Search and Navigation**: Built-in tools for locating and managing specific devices

### Navigation Structure

The interface provides structured navigation with a sidebar categorizing device types, making it easy to:

- **Browse by Category**: Navigate between Push and Pull device sections
- **View Device Counts**: See at-a-glance totals for each device type
- **Access Management Tools**: Quick access to creation, editing, and monitoring functions
- **Filter and Search**: Locate specific devices using various criteria

## Key Management Capabilities

- **Director Filtering**: View devices by director assignment for organized management
- **Real-Time Results**: Instant filtering as you type search criteria

## Device Types Deep Dive

### Syslog Devices

Syslog devices provide comprehensive log collection capabilities with:

- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Support for both UDP and TCP transport protocols
- **Port Configuration**: Flexible port assignment for network integration
- **Director Assignment**: Association with one or more directors for processing
- **Preprocessing Pipelines**: Data transformation capabilities for incoming logs

### Windows Agents

Windows Agent devices offer specialized features for Windows system monitoring:

- **System-Specific Installation**: Agents tied to specific Windows systems
- **Director Dependency**: Require active director connections for operation
- **Custom Log Selection**: Configurable log sources and performance counters
- **Real-Time Connectivity**: Live connection status monitoring

### Network Protocol Devices

HTTP, UDP, TCP, and eStreamer devices provide:

- **Protocol-Specific Configuration**: Tailored settings for each network protocol
- **Security Options**: TLS/SSL support for secure communications
- **Connection Management**: Advanced connection handling and reliability options
- **Multi-Address Support**: Configuration with multiple network addresses for redundancy

## Best Practices

### Device Organization

- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive, consistent naming for easy identification
- **Environment Separation**: Maintain separate device configurations for different environments
- **Director Distribution**: Balance device assignments across multiple directors
- **Documentation**: Include clear descriptions for complex device configurations

### Security Considerations

- **Secure Communications**: Use TLS encryption for sensitive data transmission
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Network Security**: Configure appropriate firewall rules and network policies
- **Regular Updates**: Keep agents and device configurations current

### Performance Optimization

- **Load Balancing**: Distribute devices across multiple directors for optimal performance
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track system resource usage and capacity planning
- **Connection Management**: Monitor and maintain healthy device connections
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review device configurations and performance

The Devices Dashboard provides the foundation for comprehensive data ingestion management, ensuring reliable and efficient data collection across your entire infrastructure while maintaining security and operational excellence.
