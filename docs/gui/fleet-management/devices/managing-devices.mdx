# Managing Devices

To manage devices, go to **Home** → **Fleet Management** → **Devices**. Select a device type from the sidebar to see its table, where you can monitor status and perform operations.

## Search and Filter

- **Search devices** - Filter by device name
- **Directors filter** - Show devices for specific directors  
- **Status filter** - Filter by Enabled/Disabled status

## Edit

To edit a device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row
- Select **Edit device details**

This takes you through the same configuration steps as creation, where you can modify:

- Device name and description
- Director assignments  
- Network settings (ports, protocols)
- Advanced configuration options

## Clone

To create a copy of an existing device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row
- Select **Clone device**

:::note
Windows agents cannot be cloned since they're tied to specific systems.
:::

The cloned device inherits all settings but gets:

- A new unique name
- A new unique port (if port conflicts exist)
- Same director assignments (unless changed)

:::caution
Ensure port numbers are unique when cloning to avoid conflicts.

## Status

To enable or disable a device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row
- Select **Enable device** or **Disable device**

Disabling a device stops data collection but preserves all configuration settings.

## Delete

To remove a device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row  
- Select **Delete**
- Confirm the deletion in the modal prompt

:::warning
Device deletion is permanent and removes all configuration data.
