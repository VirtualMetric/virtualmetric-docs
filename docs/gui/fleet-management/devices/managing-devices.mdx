- **Change Confirmation**: Review and confirm all configuration modifications

### Device Cloning Operations

Device cloning streamlines the setup process for similar devices while ensuring unique configurations:

**Cloning Process:**
- **Configuration Inheritance**: Copy all settings from the source device
- **Unique Identifier Assignment**: System generates unique names and identifiers
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Automatic detection and resolution of port conflicts
- **Director Assignment**: Option to maintain or modify director associations

**Cloning Validation:**

:::caution
When cloning devices, ensure port numbers are unique to avoid conflicts. The system validates port availability and displays errors for duplicate port assignments.
:::

**Conflict Resolution:**
- **Port Uniqueness**: Automatic checking for port conflicts with suggestions for alternatives
- **Name Validation**: Ensure cloned devices have unique names within the system
- **Resource Validation**: Verify that cloned devices don't exceed system resource limits
- **Configuration Validation**: Check that cloned configurations are valid and complete

## Device Status Management

### Operational State Control

Manage device operational states to control data collection without losing configuration:

**Enable/Disable Operations:**
- **Graceful State Changes**: Smooth transitions between enabled and disabled states

- **Update Management**: Manage agent software updates and configuration changes

**Agent Limitations:**
Windows Agent devices have specific management characteristics:
- **No Cloning Support**: Agents cannot be cloned due to system-specific installations
- **System Dependency**: Each agent is tied to a specific Windows system
- **Director Dependency**: Agents require operational directors for functionality
- **Unique Configuration**: Each agent has system-specific configuration requirements

## Device Deletion and Cleanup

### Safe Device Removal Process

Device deletion includes comprehensive safety measures to prevent data loss and system disruption:

**Deletion Confirmation Process:**
- **Impact Assessment**: Analysis of data flows and dependent systems
- **Warning Display**: Clear indication of deletion consequences and affected components
- **Multi-Step Confirmation**: Multiple validation steps to prevent accidental deletion
- **Alternative Options**: Suggestions for disabling devices instead of deletion

**Safety Validations:**
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Identify all data flows that will be affected by device deletion
- **Dependency Checking**: Review all systems and processes that depend on the device
- **Backup Recommendations**: Suggest configuration export before deletion
- **Recovery Options**: Provide information about recovery procedures if needed

:::warning
Device deletion is irreversible and will stop all data collection for the deleted device. Ensure you have proper backups and understand the impact before proceeding with deletion.
