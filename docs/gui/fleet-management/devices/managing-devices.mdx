# Managing Devices

To manage a device:

- In the **Home** view, click **Fleet Management**&nbsp;>&nbsp;**Devices**

-or-

- From the hamburger menu on the top left, select **Fleet Management**&nbsp;>&nbsp;**Devices**

Then, on the **Devices** view, click on your push/pull device type's card.

This takes you to a configuration view with the following elements:

- On the left, a **sidebar** listing the same device types as the cards shown on the **Devices** view. The device type card you have clicked on will be selected with blue.
- On the right, a table listing all the available devices created previously, if any.

At the first row of that table, you will see:

- A **Search devices** box to type the name of a device to filter the list
- A **Director(s)** dropdown to filter the list by the director(s) that devices of this type are attached to
- A **Status** filter to select _All_, _Enabled_, or _Disabled_
- A blue **Add new device** button used to create new devices of the type you have currently selected.

At the bottom of the table you will see:

- A **Page size** selector
- A pagination control to select the page of the list to view

The table displays the properties of the selected device type as columns. The listed devices will display the values assigned to its fields either initially at creation time or afterwards at editing time.

## Editing

The editing steps available differs based on the device's push/pull functionality, and the settings to be edited are device-specific.

To edit a device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row
- Select **Edit device details**

### Push Devices

For push devices, the procedure takes you through the same configuration steps as found at the initial <Topic id="gui-push-device-specific">device creation</Topic>.

### Pull Devices

For pull devices, the procedure contains configuration steps not found at the initial device creation. See below.

## Cloning (Push devices only)

To create a copy of an existing device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row
- Select **Clone device**

:::note
Agents cannot be cloned since they're tied to specific systems.
:::

The cloned device inherits all settings but gets:

- A new unique name by prepending `Copy of` to the old name
- A new unique port (if port conflicts exist)
- Same director assignments (unless changed)

:::caution
Ensure port numbers are unique when cloning to avoid conflicts.
:::

## Status Change

To enable or disable a device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row
- Select **Enable device** or **Disable device**

:::note
The action menu shows "`Disable device`" for enabled devices and "`Enable device`" for disabled devices.
:::

Disabling a device stops data collection but preserves all configuration settings.

## Deleting

Before attempting to delete a device, make sure that it is not a dependency for any routes.

:::info
Devices that are part of route configurations cannot be deleted. They must be removed from those routes first.
:::

To remove a device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row  
- Select **Delete**
- Confirm the deletion in the modal prompt

:::warning
Device deletion is permanent and immediately stops all data flows from the device's source on that pipeline.
