# Creating Devices

This guide covers the creation and configuration of Push devices, which are network-accessible endpoints that receive incoming log data from external sources. Push devices listen on specified ports and protocols to provide centralized data collection points for your infrastructure.

## Device Creation Wizard

### Step 1: Device Type Selection and Basic Configuration

Begin device creation by selecting the appropriate protocol and configuring basic device properties:

**Device Type Selection:**
The device creation wizard provides several Push device types:

- **Syslog**: Standard protocol for collecting and forwarding log messages from various systems
- **HTTP**: Enables log data ingestion through HTTP protocol for web-based data transmission
- **UDP**: Collects logs using User Datagram Protocol for fast, connectionless communication
- **TCP**: Uses Transmission Control Protocol for reliable, connection-oriented data delivery
- **eStreamer**: Specialized protocol for network security device integration and event data retrieval

**Basic Configuration Requirements:**

- **Device Name**: Unique identifier for the device within your DataStream environment
- **Description**: Optional descriptive text explaining the device's purpose and usage
- **Director Assignment**: Select which directors will manage this device for processing and routing

### Step 2: Protocol-Specific Configuration

The second step provides configuration options tailored to your selected device type:

**Common Configuration Elements:**

- **Network Settings**: Port assignments, IP address bindings, and network interface configuration
- **Security Parameters**: Authentication requirements, encryption settings, and access controls
- **Data Handling Preferences**: Buffer sizes, connection limits, and processing parameters
- **Monitoring Options**: Health check settings and performance monitoring configuration

**Protocol-Specific Settings:**

**TCP Device Configuration:**

- **Connection Management**: Timeout settings, maximum concurrent connections, and connection persistence
- **Reliability Parameters**: Connection retry logic, acknowledgment settings, and error handling
- **Buffer Configuration**: Send and receive buffer sizes for optimal performance

**TCP with TLS Configuration:**

- **Security Certificates**: SSL/TLS certificate management and validation settings
- **Encryption Settings**: Cipher suites, protocol versions, and encryption strength requirements
- **Authentication**: Client certificate validation and mutual authentication configuration
- **Security Validation Parameters**: Certificate revocation checking and trust store management

**HTTP Device Configuration:**

- **HTTP Methods**: Supported HTTP methods (POST, PUT) for data submission
- **URL Routing**: Endpoint paths and routing configuration for incoming requests
- **Authentication**: HTTP authentication methods including basic auth, tokens, and API keys
- **Content Handling**: Request size limits, content-type validation, and data format requirements

**Syslog Device Configuration:**

- **Syslog Standards**: RFC compliance settings and message format requirements
- **Facility and Priority**: Syslog facility mapping and priority level handling
- **Message Parsing**: Custom parsing rules and field extraction configuration
- **Protocol Transport**: UDP/TCP selection for syslog message transmission

### Step 3: Final Configuration and Network Settings

The final configuration step includes advanced settings and network accessibility options:

**Network Accessibility:**

- **Single Address Configuration**: Simple setup with one IP address and port combination
- **Multiple Address Configuration**: Configure multiple network addresses for improved accessibility and redundancy
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming connections across multiple addresses
- **Failover Configuration**: Set up redundant network paths for high availability

**Advanced Configuration Options:**

- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Select data transformation pipelines for incoming log processing
- **Connection Limits**: Set maximum concurrent connections and rate limiting
- **Timeout Configuration**: Connection and idle timeout settings
- **Logging Settings**: Device-specific logging levels and retention policies

## Device Configuration Management

### Multi-Director Support

Devices can be configured with multiple directors for enhanced capabilities:

**Benefits of Multiple Directors:**

- **Load Distribution**: Spread processing load across multiple directors
- **High Availability**: Provide failover capability if one director becomes unavailable
- **Geographic Distribution**: Place directors closer to data sources for optimal performance
- **Specialized Processing**: Use different directors for different types of data processing

**Configuration Considerations:**

- **Director Selection**: Choose directors based on capacity, location, and specialization
- **Load Balancing**: Configure how data is distributed among assigned directors
- **Failover Behavior**: Define how the system handles director failures
- **Monitoring**: Track performance across all assigned directors

### Director Selection Interface

The director selection interface provides comprehensive options for associating devices with directors:

**Director Status Verification:**

- **Operational State**: Ensure selected directors are operational and connected
- **Capacity Assessment**: Review director capacity and current load
- **Network Connectivity**: Verify network connectivity between directors and devices
- **Performance Metrics**: Consider director performance history and capabilities

**Selection Criteria:**

- **Geographic Proximity**: Choose directors that are geographically close to data sources
- **Processing Specialization**: Select directors optimized for specific data types
- **Resource Availability**: Consider director resource availability and capacity
- **Redundancy Requirements**: Ensure adequate redundancy for critical data flows

## Device Creation Best Practices

### Naming and Documentation

**Device Naming Conventions:**

- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive names that indicate device purpose and location
- **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent naming patterns across your environment
- **Environment Indicators**: Include environment identifiers (prod, staging, dev) in device names
- **Protocol Identification**: Include protocol type in device names for easy identification

**Documentation Standards:**

- **Purpose Description**: Clearly document what each device is intended to collect
- **Source Systems**: Document which systems send data to each device
- **Configuration Details**: Maintain records of special configuration requirements
- **Contact Information**: Include responsible team or contact information

### Network Configuration

**Port Management:**

- **Unique Port Assignment**: Ensure each device uses unique ports to avoid conflicts
- **Port Range Planning**: Plan port ranges for different device types and environments
- **Firewall Coordination**: Coordinate with network teams for firewall rule updates
- **Port Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive port assignment documentation

**Security Configuration:**

- **Encryption Requirements**: Use TLS encryption for sensitive data transmission
- **Authentication Setup**: Implement appropriate authentication methods for device access
- **Access Control**: Configure network access controls to restrict device access
- **Security Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for security-related events and alerts

## Common Device Types Configuration

### Syslog Device Setup

Syslog devices are among the most common Push devices, requiring specific configuration:

**Standard Syslog Configuration:**
- **Protocol Selection**: Choose UDP for high-throughput or TCP for reliability
- **Port Configuration**: Standard port 514 or custom ports based on network requirements
- **Message Format**: Configure message parsing for different syslog formats
- **Facility Mapping**: Set up facility and severity level mapping

### HTTP Device Configuration

HTTP devices provide web-based data ingestion capabilities:

**HTTP Endpoint Configuration:**

- **URL Structure**: Define endpoint URLs and routing patterns
- **Request Methods**: Configure supported HTTP methods (POST, PUT)
- **Content Types**: Specify accepted content types and formats
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for incoming requests

### Specialized Protocol Devices

**eStreamer Device Configuration:**
