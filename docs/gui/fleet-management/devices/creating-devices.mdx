# Creating Devices

Creating devices in DataStream involves configuring data input sources that will send logs and telemetry data to your DataStream directors. The platform supports both **Push devices** (which send data to DataStream) and **Pull devices** (Agents that collect data locally). This guide covers the comprehensive device creation process.

## Device Types

### Push Devices
Push devices actively send data to DataStream directors using various protocols:
- **Syslog**: Standard syslog protocol for system and application logs
- **HTTP**: Web-based data ingestion for REST API integrations
- **UDP**: User Datagram Protocol for high-throughput data streams
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol for reliable data delivery
- **eStreamer**: Cisco's eStreamer protocol for security event data

### Pull Devices (Agents)
Pull devices are agents installed on target systems that actively collect and forward data:
- **Windows Agent**: Collects Windows event logs, system metrics, and application data

## Device Creation Process

The device creation process uses a guided wizard approach that walks you through the complete setup process:

### Step 1: Device Type Selection and Basic Configuration

The first step establishes the foundation for your device configuration:

- **Choose the appropriate protocol** (Syslog, HTTP, UDP, TCP, eStreamer)
- **Set device name and description** for identification and management purposes
- **Configure initial parameters** specific to the selected protocol
- **Define basic operational settings** that will govern device behavior

### Step 2: Advanced Protocol Configuration

This step provides protocol-specific configuration options tailored to your selected device type, including:

- **Network settings and connection parameters**: Define how the device will communicate with directors
- **Security parameters and authentication options**: Configure encryption, certificates, and access controls
- **Data handling preferences and processing rules**: Set up parsing, filtering, and transformation options

#### TCP Device Configuration
For TCP devices, this step includes specific configuration for connection handling:
- **Timeout settings**: Define connection and read timeout values
- **Connection limits**: Set maximum concurrent connection limits
- **Reliability parameters**: Configure retry logic and error handling
- **TLS Security**: When configuring secure TCP connections with TLS, additional options become available for certificate management, encryption settings, and security validation parameters

#### Network Redundancy
During configuration, you can specify multiple network addresses for improved accessibility and network redundancy, ensuring your devices remain reachable even if primary network paths experience issues.

### Step 3: Final Configuration and Confirmation

The final step provides a comprehensive configuration summary and confirmation interface before device creation:

- **Configuration Review**: Review all settings including protocol parameters, network configuration, and security options
- **Final Adjustments**: Make any necessary changes before committing the configuration
- **Validation Checks**: System performs final validation to ensure configuration integrity
- **Creation Confirmation**: Confirm device creation and proceed with deployment

## Device Cloning

Device cloning creates a new device based on an existing configuration, significantly streamlining the setup process for similar devices. This feature is particularly useful when deploying multiple devices with similar configurations across different network segments or locations.

### Cloning Process
1. **Select Source Device**: Choose the device to use as a template
2. **Modify Unique Parameters**: Update device name, network settings, and other unique identifiers
3. **Port Validation**: Ensure port numbers are unique to avoid conflicts
4. **Configuration Review**: Verify all settings before creating the cloned device

:::caution
When cloning devices, ensure port numbers are unique to avoid conflicts. The system validates port availability and displays errors for duplicate ports, preventing configuration conflicts that could disrupt data collection.

## Multi-Director Configuration

Devices can be associated with multiple directors for load balancing and redundancy purposes.
