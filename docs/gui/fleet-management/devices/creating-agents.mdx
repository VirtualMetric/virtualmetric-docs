1. **Setup Device** - Configure name and director (completed above)
2. **Install and Connect** - Download and install the agent on target system  
3. **Review and Configure** - Select log sources and finalize setup

### Step 3: Log Selection

## Installation Status

During installation, you'll see different status indicators:

- **Loading** - Agent installation in progress
- **Installed - Not Connected** - Agent installed but not yet connected to director
- **Connected** - Agent successfully connected and collecting data
- **Connection Failed** - Agent installed but connection to director failed
