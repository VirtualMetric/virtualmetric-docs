**Connection Verified State:**
When connection validation succeeds, users see:
- **Success Confirmation**: Clear confirmation of successful connection establishment
- **Performance Metrics**: Initial connection quality measurements including latency and throughput
- **Next Steps**: Clear guidance for proceeding with the full installation process
- **Configuration Summary**: Review of verified connection parameters for final confirmation

### Installation Configuration

The installation configuration phase includes validation systems to ensure proper director setup and prevent conflicts.

Name uniqueness validation ensures proper director identification:

- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatic checking for existing director names across the entire system
- **Naming Guidelines**: Best practices for director naming conventions and restrictions
- **Validation Rules**: Requirements for valid director names including character limits and format rules
- **Suggestion Engine**: Alternative names when conflicts are detected, based on the intended name

### Installation Steps

The installation process is divided into clear steps with progress tracking and validation at each stage.

**Step 1 - Initial Configuration:**
The first installation step focuses on basic setup and connection options:
- **Basic Setup**: Director name, description, and initial parameter configuration
- **Connection Options**: Choose between immediate connection establishment or deferred setup for later configuration
- **Network Configuration**: Define communication protocols, endpoints, and network security settings
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear progress indicators showing installation stage and remaining steps

**Step 2 - Finalization:**
The second step completes the installation and performs final validation:
- **Record Creation**: Successful director record establishment in the system database
- **Connection Status**: Current connectivity state and available connection options
- **Post-Installation Tasks**: Required actions after director creation including initial testing
- **Verification Steps**: Final checks to ensure proper installation and readiness for operation

**Connection Verification:**
The final verification process ensures the director is ready for production use:
- **Automated Testing**: System-initiated connection tests to verify all functionality
- **Manual Verification**: User-controlled connection validation for specific use cases
- **Performance Baseline**: Initial performance measurements to establish operational baselines
- **Health Check Setup**: Configuration of ongoing monitoring and health check systems

## Director Edit Actions

When working with individual directors, a comprehensive action menu provides access to all management functions. These actions are available through the director's context menu or detail view.

The action menu provides essential director management functions:

- **Edit Configuration**: Modify director settings and parameters through a detailed configuration interface
- **Restart Director**: Safely restart director services with proper shutdown and startup procedures
- **View Logs**: Access detailed director operation logs for troubleshooting and monitoring
- **Test Connection**: Verify director connectivity and functionality with automated diagnostic tests
- **Delete Director**: Remove director with proper validation and safety checks

## Director Edit Details

The director configuration interface provides comprehensive access to all director settings through a well-organized form divided into logical sections for easy navigation.

The director configuration interface is divided into multiple sections:

**Section 1 - Basic Configuration:**
- **Name and Description**: Director identification fields and documentation notes
- **Connection Settings**: Network parameters including IP addresses, ports, and communication protocols
- **Authentication**: Security credentials, API keys, and access methods
- **Timeout Settings**: Connection timeout, operation timeout, and retry interval values

**Section 2 - Advanced Options:**
- **Monitoring Configuration**: Health check intervals, performance thresholds, and alert conditions
- **Logging Settings**: Log levels, retention policies, and output destinations
- **Performance Tuning**: Buffer sizes, concurrent connection limits, and processing parameters
- **Custom Properties**: Environment-specific configuration options and custom metadata fields

## Director Status Management

The system provides specialized interfaces for managing directors in different operational states, including tools for handling disabled directors and maintaining system stability.

When a director is disabled, the management interface provides:

- **Status Indicator**: Clear indication of disabled state with explanatory messaging
- **Reason Display**: Information about why the director was disabled, including error details or administrative notes
- **Enable Options**: Controls to reactivate the director when issues are resolved
- **Historical Data**: Maintained access to logs and historical performance data for analysis
- **Safe Mode**: Limited functionality options for troubleshooting without full activation

## Director Reinstallation

The director reinstallation feature provides a safe method to refresh director installations when needed. This process is accessible through the director management interface and includes comprehensive safety measures.

The reinstallation process provides a safe method to refresh director installations:

**Reinstall Initiation:**

- **Backup Current State**: Automatically preserve existing configuration and operational data
- **Service Validation**: Verify that reinstallation is safe to proceed without disrupting critical operations
- **Dependency Check**: Ensure all required components and dependencies are available

**Reinstall Process Options:**

- **Full Reinstall**: Complete director reinstallation with fresh components and clean configuration
- **Configuration Preserve**: Maintain existing settings during reinstall to minimize reconfiguration
- **Rollback Plan**: Automatic fallback procedures if reinstallation fails or encounters errors
- **Monitoring During Process**: Real-time status updates and progress tracking during reinstallation

:::warning
Director reinstallation will temporarily interrupt data flow. Plan reinstallation during maintenance windows to minimize impact.
