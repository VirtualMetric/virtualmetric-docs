# Managing Directors

To manage directors, go to **Home** > **Directors**. From the table presented, you can monitor the availability and status of directors, and perform various operations on them.

## Edit

To edit the details of a director,

- Click the **Actions** menu button (&#x22EE;) on the right of its row
- Select **Edit director**

This will take you to the first tab of the **Director Details** view.

:::note
The options found on the table row through the **Actions** menu button (&#x22EE;) are also available here from the **Actions** drop-down list on the top right.
:::

To start editing the details of the director, click the **Manage director details** button on the page.

- The editable field&mdash;on this page, only the name of the director&mdash;will be enabled, and the **Cancel** and **Save changes** buttons will appear.

On the **Connection Details** tab of the view, you can check the connection status of the director.

- If the director is not connected, the **Connection Status** will be red and will read _Not connected_.
- You can also see the IP address&mdash;_None_ if there is no connection, a specific IP address if there is one&mdash;and the connection history of the director.

If necessary, you can click the **Re-install director** button to reinstall the director.

:::warning
This action severs the tie between the key you have acquired when you previously installed the director, and generates a new key after discarding the old one.
:::

You will be prompted with a modal window that your API key will be lost. Clicking **Continue** on that modal window takes you to the **Connection Details** page where you will be presented with a new API key and the installation script. (See the <Topic id="gui-creating-directors">previous chapter</Topic> for the installation procedure.)

On the **Activity logs** tab of the view, you will find information on the activity of the director in table form. The table has the following columns:

- **User** - e-mail address of the user of the director
- **User IP** - the IP assigned to the user of the director
- **Object type** - by default, _Director_
- **Object** - the specific director with the unique named given during creation
- **Action** - the specific type of action performed on the director
- **Action Description** - detailed description of the activity
- **Date** - the date the action was performed

## Enable/Disable

To enable or disable a director,

- Click the **Actions** menu button (&#x22EE;) on the right of its row
- Select **Enable director**/**Disable director** from the drop-down list

Disabling a director stops the devices and targets managed by that director that were receiving and sending data to stop their activity.

## Delete

To delete a director,

- Click the **Actions** menu button (&#x22EE;) on the right of its row
- Select **Delete director** from the drop-down list

If there devices or targets attached to the director, selecting this option opens a modal warning window where you are presented with the specifics of the data stream components the director is managing.

:::info
You cannot delete a director before removing any devices or targets attached to it first. Check the info on the warning window to see which components need to be removed.
