# Troubleshooting Directors

This guide addresses common issues and problems that may occur when managing directors in DataStream. Directors are critical components that coordinate data flow between devices and targets, so proper troubleshooting is essential for maintaining system reliability.

## Connection Issues

### Connection Failed State

**Problem:** Director shows connection failed status during installation or operation.

**Symptoms:**
- Director displays "Connection Failed" status
- Unable to establish communication with director
- Error messages during director setup
- Devices cannot connect to director

**Solutions:**
When connection validation fails, the system provides comprehensive diagnostic information:

- **Error Diagnosis**: Review detailed information about connection failures including specific error codes and descriptions
- **Network Connectivity**: Verify network connectivity between DataStream and the director host
- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure proper firewall configuration allows director communication
- **Port Availability**: Check that required ports are not blocked or in use by other services
- **DNS Resolution**: Verify hostname resolution if using domain names instead of IP addresses
- **Authentication**: Confirm credentials and authentication methods are correctly configured
- **Retry Options**: Use the retry function after making corrections without restarting the entire process

### Connection Pending Issues

**Problem:** Director shows "installed but not connected" status after installation.

**Symptoms:**
- Installation completes successfully but connection remains pending
- Director appears in interface but shows disconnected status
- Intermittent connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
- Wait 2-5 minutes for initial connection establishment (this is normal)
- Check director service status on the host system
- Verify network stability between DataStream and director
- Review director logs for connection attempts and errors
- Restart director service if connection doesn't establish within reasonable time

## Installation Problems

### Installation Failures

**Problem:** Director installation process fails or cannot complete.

**Symptoms:**
- Installation wizard reports errors
- Director creation process stops unexpectedly
- Configuration validation fails

**Solutions:**
- **Name Uniqueness**: Ensure director name is unique across the entire system
- **Resource Availability**: Verify target system has adequate resources (CPU, memory, disk space)
- **Permission Issues**: Confirm installation account has necessary privileges
- **Network Requirements**: Ensure network connectivity during installation process
- **System Requirements**: Verify target system meets minimum requirements for director installation

### Reinstallation Issues

**Problem:** Director reinstallation fails or produces unexpected results.

**Symptoms:**
- Reinstallation process cannot complete
- Previous configuration conflicts with new installation
- Director functionality is impaired after reinstallation

**Solutions:**
- **Clean Uninstall**: Ensure previous director installation is completely removed
- **Configuration Backup**: Verify backup of previous configuration before reinstallation
- **Rollback Plan**: Use automatic fallback procedures if reinstallation fails or encounters errors
- **Service Conflicts**: Check for conflicting services on the target system
- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions for director installation directory

## Operational Issues

### Director Disabled Status

**Problem:** Director shows disabled status and is not processing data.

**Symptoms:**
- Director appears disabled in management interface
- Data flow stops through the director
- Devices cannot connect to disabled director

**Solutions:**
- **Review Disable Reason**: Check the reason display for information about why the director was disabled
- **Error Resolution**: Address any error details or administrative notes shown
- **Safe Mode Testing**: Use limited functionality options for troubleshooting without full activation
- **Enable Options**: Use controls to reactivate the director when issues are resolved
- **Health Checks**: Perform director health verification before re-enabling

### Performance Problems

**Problem:** Director performance is degraded or inconsistent.

**Symptoms:**
- Slow data processing through director
- High resource utilization on director host
- Intermittent connectivity issues
- Data backlog or queuing issues

**Solutions:**
- **Resource Monitoring**: Check CPU, memory, and disk usage on director host
- **Network Performance**: Verify network bandwidth and latency between components
- **Configuration Review**: Assess director configuration for optimization opportunities
- **Load Balancing**: Consider distributing load across multiple directors
- **Buffer Tuning**: Adjust buffer sizes based on data volume and processing requirements

## Diagnostic Tools and Monitoring

### Director Logs

Access detailed director operation logs for troubleshooting and monitoring:
- **System Events**: Review automatic logging of connection changes, errors, and system-initiated operations
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor director throughput, latency, and resource utilization
- **Error Analysis**: Analyze error patterns and frequency for proactive issue resolution
- **Audit Trail**: Use comprehensive tracking for compliance and troubleshooting purposes

### Connection Validation Tools

- **Test Connection**: Use built-in connectivity testing tools
- **Performance Metrics**: Review initial connection quality measurements including latency and throughput
- **Configuration Summary**: Verify connection parameters are correctly configured
- **Health Indicators**: Monitor ongoing operational status and connection health

## Prevention and Best Practices

### Proactive Monitoring
- **Regular Health Checks**: Schedule routine director health verification
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track director performance metrics continuously
- **Log Analysis**: Regularly review director logs for early warning signs
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource utilization trends and plan for growth

### Configuration Management
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of director configurations
- **Backup Procedures**: Keep regular backups of director configurations
- **Change Control**: Implement proper change management for director modifications
- **Version Control**: Track director software versions and update schedules

### Network and Security
- **Network Monitoring**: Continuously monitor network connectivity and performance
- **Security Audits**: Regular security reviews of director access and authentication
- **Firewall Management**: Maintain proper firewall rules and monitor for changes
- **Certificate Management**: Keep security certificates current and properly configured

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Multi-Director Scenarios
- **Load Balancing Issues**: Troubleshoot uneven load distribution across directors
- **Failover Problems**: Address director failover and recovery scenarios
- **Synchronization Issues**: Resolve configuration synchronization problems between directors

### Integration Problems
- **Device Connectivity**: Troubleshoot device-to-director connection issues
- **Target Communication**: Resolve director-to-target communication problems
- **Pipeline Processing**: Address data processing issues within director pipelines

### When to Contact Support

Contact support when:
- Issues persist after following troubleshooting procedures
- Director software appears to be malfunctioning
- Security-related problems are encountered
- System-wide director issues affect multiple installations
- Complex multi-director deployment problems occur
