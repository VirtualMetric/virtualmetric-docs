# Creating Directors

Creating a new **Director** in DataStream involves a comprehensive configuration process designed to ensure proper setup, validation, and deployment. This guide covers the complete director creation workflow from initial setup to final verification.

## Accessing Director Creation

To create a new **Director**, click the **Create Director** button located in the top right corner of the Directors view. This opens the director creation interface where you can configure essential director properties.

## Director Creation Form

The comprehensive director creation form provides all necessary configuration options for setting up a new director. The form is organized into logical sections to streamline the setup process.

The detailed director creation form includes:

- **Basic Information**: Name, description, and organizational tags
- **Network Configuration**: IP addresses, ports, and connection protocols
- **Security Settings**: Authentication methods and encryption requirements
- **Monitoring Options**: Health check intervals and notification preferences
- **Advanced Settings**: Custom parameters and specialized configurations

### Essential Configuration Fields

The director creation interface allows you to configure essential director properties including:

- **Director Name**: Unique identifier for the director instance
- **Connection Details**: Network configuration and authentication settings
- **Device Associations**: Link directors to specific devices or device groups
- **Permission Settings**: Define access levels and operational capabilities

## Installation Process

The director installation process guides users through a step-by-step workflow to ensure proper director setup and configuration. The process includes validation steps and error handling to maximize installation success.

### Step 1 - Initial Configuration

The first installation step focuses on basic setup and connection options:
- **Basic Setup**: Director name, description, and initial parameter configuration
- **Connection Options**: Choose between immediate connection establishment or deferred setup for later configuration
- **Network Configuration**: Define communication protocols, endpoints, and network security settings
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear progress indicators showing installation stage and remaining steps

### Step 2 - Connection Validation

The connection validation process ensures proper director setup before proceeding with full installation. This critical step prevents installation failures and ensures reliable operation.

**Connection Failed State:**
When connection validation fails, the system provides:
- **Error Diagnosis**: Detailed information about connection failures including specific error codes and descriptions
- **Troubleshooting Steps**: Guided assistance for resolving connectivity issues with step-by-step instructions
- **Retry Options**: Ability to test connection after making corrections without restarting the entire process
- **Support Resources**: Direct links to documentation and support channels for additional assistance

**Connection Verified State:**
When connection validation succeeds, users see:
- **Success Confirmation**: Clear confirmation of successful connection establishment
- **Performance Metrics**: Initial connection quality measurements including latency and throughput
- **Next Steps**: Clear guidance for proceeding with the full installation process
- **Configuration Summary**: Review of verified connection parameters for final confirmation

### Step 3 - Finalization

The final step completes the installation and performs final validation:
- **Record Creation**: Successful director record establishment in the system database
- **Connection Status**: Current connectivity state and available connection options
- **Post-Installation Tasks**: Required actions after director creation including initial testing
- **Verification Steps**: Final checks to ensure proper installation and readiness for operation

## Validation Systems

### Name Uniqueness Validation

Name uniqueness validation ensures proper director identification:

- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatic checking for existing director names across the entire system
- **Naming Guidelines**: Best practices for director naming conventions and restrictions
- **Validation Rules**: Requirements for valid director names including character limits and format rules
- **Suggestion Engine**: Alternative names when conflicts are detected, based on the intended name

## Best Practices

- **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the director's purpose or location
- **Network Planning**: Ensure proper network connectivity and firewall configuration before creation
- **Security Configuration**: Implement appropriate authentication and encryption settings for your environment
- **Testing Protocol**: Verify director functionality immediately after creation to ensure proper operation
