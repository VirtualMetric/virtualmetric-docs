# Creating Directors

To create a new director

- Go to the **Home** page
- Find the **Fleet Management** pane 
- Click the **Directors** link.

On the next page, click the **Create director** button. This will take you to the area where you will name and install a new director. You can also manage the already installed directors here.

On the **Director Setup** tab

- In the text box under **Name**, enter a unique name for director. If the name was used before, you will get an error when you attempt to create the director.
- In the **Choose installation type**, select _Standalone_. This will install **Director** on a single machine.

:::note
This type of installation is not backed up and has no load balancing.

If at some point you change your mind, you can click **Cancel** to terminate the process.

To continue, click the **Create director** button.

This creates a record for the director you are creating, and prompt you that it was added to the list. You will also be notified that the director has not been installed been enabled since you have not yet installed a **Director** for it.

To install a **Director** for the director you have created, you will have to run an installation script. The interface provides the platform-specific script with the **PowerShell** (default) and **Bash** buttons.

Under these buttons, you will see a box containing a newly-generated API key. You will use this to install a **Director**.

<Include id="admin-for-installation-script" />

- Open a terminal window with admin access
- Copy the above-mentioned key and script
- Paste it in the prompt
- Press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short> to start running the script

This will take a few minutes to complete.

To the right, you will see a **Verify connection** button. Clicking this button starts sending a request to check whether a **Director** has been installed.

<Include id="connection-verification-failure" />

If the connection is not verified, you can use the **Connect Later** button to defer this installation step. However, the not-yet-enabled director will still appear on the directors list.

Once the connection is verified, you will be prompted with a **Connection succesful** message.

To complete the process, click the enabled **Complete setup** button and return to the directors list. You will see a notification that a new director has been created and connected above the table, and the newly-created director will appear in the list as _Enabled_ and _Connected_.
