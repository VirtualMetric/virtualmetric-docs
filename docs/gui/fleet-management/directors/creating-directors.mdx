# Creating Directors

Creating a new **Director** involves a simple two-step process: providing a name and installation type, then installing the director using the generated key.

## Step 1: Director Setup

Enter the director name and choose the installation type. The Standalone option is selected by default for single-system installation.

### Required Fields

- **Name**: Enter a unique name for your director
- **Choose installation type**: Select "Standalone" for single-system setup

Click **Create director** to proceed to the installation step.

## Step 2: Install and Connect Director

After creating the director, you will receive an installation key and instructions for connecting the director.

### Installation Process

The system provides:
- **Installation Script**: Use the provided PowerShell or Bash script
- **Installation Key**: A generated key for director authentication
- **Connection Status**: Monitor the connection verification process

### Connection Verification

- **Director Status**: Shows "Director is not connected yet" until installation is complete
- **Installation Instructions**: Install and run the VirtualMetric Director on your server using the provided script
- **Connection Monitoring**: The system will verify the connection once the director is installed and running

Use **Connect later** if you want to complete the installation at a different time, or **Complete setup** once the director is successfully connected.
