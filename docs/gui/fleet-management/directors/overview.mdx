# Directors Overview

This is the working area where you manage your **Director**s. Directors are essential components that facilitate communication between your DataStream infrastructure and remote devices or systems.

The main directors view provides a comprehensive overview of all your directors, including their connection status, configuration details, and available management actions. From this central location, you can monitor director health, manage installations, and perform administrative tasks. The view displays all active directors in a grid layout with status indicators, performance metrics, and quick access to management functions.

## Director Management Notifications

The system provides comprehensive notification systems to alert users about critical director states and dependencies that may affect system operation.

The system provides critical notifications when director dependencies are not met:

**No Director Warning:**
When attempting operations that require directors but none are available, the system displays:
- **Dependency Alert**: Clear indication that directors are required for device operations and other functionality
- **Impact Explanation**: Detailed description of functionality that will be unavailable without proper director infrastructure
- **Resolution Steps**: Step-by-step guidance on creating or configuring directors to resolve the dependency
- **Alternative Actions**: Temporary workarounds when directors are not immediately available

This notification appears when attempting to add devices without proper director infrastructure, ensuring users understand the prerequisites for device management and can take appropriate action to resolve the dependency.
