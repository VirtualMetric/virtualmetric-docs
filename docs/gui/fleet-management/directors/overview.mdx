# Directors: Overview

This is the working area where you manage your directors.

The default view contains a table listing directors currently installed on your system, if any, that have been configured and are in various states.

## Directors table

At the top of the table, there's a text box that can be used to filter the list by _name_.

Next to it is a drop down box to filter the list by _status_.

At the bottom, there's a pagination button you can use to navigate further down the list in case the number of directors available do not fit on a single page.

To the right of each row in the table, you will see a `>` button which will open a drop-down menu containing the basic actions you can perform on a director:

- **Edit director** - takes you to the details view where you can edit the parameters of the director
- **Enable**/**Disable** - toggles for enabling or disabling the director
- **Delete** - deletes the director

See <Topic id="gui-managing-directors">Managing Directors</Topic> for details.

## Table columns

The table has the following fields:

- **Name** - The unique name assigned when the director was created
- **Platform Type** - By default _Self-managed_
- **Installation Type** - By default _Standalone_
- **Status** - Can be _Enabled_/_Disabled_
- **Connection Status** - If the director has not been connected to any data stream yet, or if the connection is not valid or not working, the director appears as _Not Connected_ and is colored red. Otherwise, it is _Connected_ and is colored green

Finally, there's a **Create director** button at the top right which you can use to initiate the process of creating a director.

See <Topic id="gui-creating-directors">Creating Directors</Topic> for details.
