# Directors: Overview

This is the working area where you manage your directors.

The default view contains the following key elements:

- **Directors table** - Lists directors currently installed on your system, if any, that have been configured and are in various states
- **Search directors** - Text box to filter the list by _Name_
- **Status filter** - Dropdown to filter the list by _Status_
- **Pagination button** - To navigate further down the list in case the number of directors available do not fit on a single page

To the right of each row in the table, you will see the **Actions** menu button (&#x22EE;) that opens a dropdown menu containing the basic actions you can perform on a director:

- **Edit director** - takes you to the details view where you can edit the parameters of the director
- **Enable**/**Disable** - toggles for enabling or disabling the director
- **Delete** - deletes the director

See <Topic id="gui-managing-directors">Managing Directors</Topic> for details.

## Directors Columns

The table has the following fields:

- **Name** - The unique name assigned when the director was created
- **Platform Type** - By default _Self-managed_
- **Installation Type** - By default _Standalone_
- **Status** - Can be _Enabled_/_Disabled_
- **Connection Status** - If the director has not been connected to any data stream yet, or if the connection is not valid or not working, the director appears as _Not Connected_ and is colored red. Otherwise, it is _Connected_ and is colored green

Finally, there's a **Create director** button at the top right which you can use to initiate the process of creating a director.

See <Topic id="gui-creating-directors">Creating Directors</Topic> for details.
