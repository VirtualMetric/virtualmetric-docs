# Directors: Overview

This is the working area where you manage your directors.

The default view contains the following key elements:

The **Directors table** lists directors currently installed on your system, if any, that have been configured and are in various states.

**Table controls:**
- **Search directors** - Text box to filter by director name
- **Status filter** - Dropdown to filter by director status
- **Pagination button** - Navigation control for multiple pages

**Table columns:**

- **Name** - The unique name assigned when the director was created
- **Platform Type** - By default _Self-managed_
- **Installation Type** - By default _Standalone_
- **Status** - Can be _Enabled_/_Disabled_
- **Connection Status** - If the director has not been connected to any data stream yet, or if the connection is not valid or not working, the director appears as _Not Connected_ and is colored red. Otherwise, it is _Connected_ and is colored green

**Row actions:**
- **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) - Dropdown with Edit director, Enable/Disable, Delete options

Finally, there's a **Create director** button at the top right which you can use to initiate the process of creating a director.
