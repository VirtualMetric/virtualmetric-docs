# Creating Targets

Creating **Targets** in DataStream defines where processed data will be sent after pipeline processing. Targets represent output destinations such as Azure Sentinel, files, databases, or other analytics platforms. This guide covers the comprehensive target creation process using the multi-step wizard approach.

## Target Types Overview

DataStream supports various target types for different data output requirements:

- **Azure Sentinel**: Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM and SOAR solution
- **File**: Local or network file system storage
- **Database**: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and other database systems
- **Elasticsearch**: Search and analytics engine
- **Splunk HEC**: Splunk HTTP Event Collector
- **Syslog**: Standard syslog protocol for log forwarding
- **Console**: Output for testing and debugging purposes

## Target Creation Process

The target creation process follows a multi-step wizard approach, guiding administrators through the necessary configuration phases to ensure proper setup and validation.

### Step 1: General Information

Begin target creation with essential identification and type selection. The first step presents a form for basic target properties that will be used throughout the configuration process.

Configure basic target properties:

- **Target name**: Unique identifier for the target configuration
- **Target type**: Selection from available output types (Sentinel, File, Database, etc.)
- **Description**: Optional documentation for target purpose and usage
- **Environment tags**: Categorization for development, staging, or production use

#### Target Type Selection Impact
The target type selection in Step 1 determines which configuration options become available in subsequent steps. Each target type has specific requirements and configuration parameters.

### Step 2: Azure Properties Configuration

Configure Azure-specific connection parameters for Sentinel and other Azure targets. The interface dynamically enables or disables Azure-specific fields based on the target type selected in Step 1.

#### Dynamic Configuration Interface
When Azure target types are not selected, the Azure properties section remains disabled, preventing unnecessary configuration. Once an Azure-compatible target type is chosen, the section becomes active and displays all relevant Azure configuration options.

Azure configuration includes:

- **Subscription settings**: Azure subscription ID and resource group information
- **Authentication**: Service principal credentials or managed identity configuration
- **Workspace details**: Log Analytics workspace ID and connection strings
- **Regional settings**: Azure region and data residency preferences
- **Security parameters**: SSL/TLS configuration and encryption settings

#### Azure Sentinel Specific Configuration
For Azure Sentinel targets, additional configuration options include:
- **Data Collection Rules (DCR)**: Configure automated DCR creation and management
- **Table routing**: Specify target tables for different data types
- **ASIM compliance**: Enable Advanced Security Information Model normalization

### Step 3: Stream Configuration

Configure data stream mappings and routing for the target. This step provides two primary configuration modes to accommodate different setup preferences and technical requirements.

#### Automatic Stream Configuration

The system can automatically detect available data streams and suggest optimal routing configurations. This mode analyzes existing pipeline outputs and recommends appropriate stream assignments based on data types and target compatibility.

**Benefits of Automatic Configuration:**
- Reduced setup time and complexity
- Optimized routing based on data analysis
- Minimized configuration errors
- Best practice recommendations

#### Manual Stream Configuration

For advanced users or specific requirements, manual configuration provides granular control over stream routing and data processing rules. This mode allows custom mapping of data streams to target-specific formats and routing logic.

**Manual Configuration Advantages:**
- Complete control over data routing
- Custom transformation rules
- Specialized filtering criteria
- Advanced performance tuning

#### Stream Configuration Options

Stream configuration options include:

- **Automatic detection**: System-identified data streams with recommended routing
- **Manual selection**: Custom stream mapping for specific data types
- **Filtering rules**: Include/exclude criteria for data stream processing
- **Format options**: Output format selection (JSON, CEF, LEEF, Custom)
- **Batch settings**: Batching and buffering parameters for optimal performance

## Installation Success and Validation

Upon successful completion of the configuration wizard, the system provides confirmation of the target creation along with validation results and next steps. This confirmation phase ensures the target is properly configured and ready for operation.

Successful target creation provides:

- **Confirmation status**: Target successfully configured and operational
- **Connection validation**: Initial connectivity test results
- **Configuration summary**: Review of all configured parameters
- **Next steps**: Guidance for additional configuration or testing
- **Monitoring setup**: Links to target performance and health monitoring
