# Managing Targets

To manage targets, go to **Home** → **Fleet Management** → **Targets**. Select a target type from the sidebar to see its table, where you can monitor status and perform operations.

## Search and Filter

- **Search targets** - Filter by target name
- **Status filter** - Filter by Enabled/Disabled status

## Edit

To edit a target:

- Click the **Actions** menu (⋮) on the target row
- Select **Edit target details**

This opens a multi-tab interface:

- **General Settings** - Name, description, status, and post-processing pipeline
- **Azure Properties** - Azure-specific configuration (for Sentinel targets)
- **Stream Properties** - Data stream routing and filtering rules

You'll also see target information on the right showing creation and update timestamps.

## Clone

To create a copy of an existing target:

- Click the **Actions** menu (⋮) on the target row
- Select **Clone target**

The cloned target inherits all settings but gets a new unique name.

## Status

To enable or disable a target:

- Click the **Actions** menu (⋮) on the target row
- Select **Enable target** or **Disable target**

The action menu shows "Disable target" for enabled targets and "Enable target" for disabled targets.

Disabling stops data flow but preserves configuration.

## Delete

To remove a target:

- Click the **Actions** menu (⋮) on the target row
- Select **Delete target**
- Confirm the deletion in the modal prompt

:::warning
Target deletion is permanent and immediately stops all data flows to that destination.
