# Targets: Overview

This is where you manage all your data output destinations.

The main view shows target types organized by category.

## Categories

- **Console** targets output data directly for debugging and testing purposes.

- **File** targets write data to files in various formats (JSON, CSV, XML) with configurable rotation and compression.

- **Microsoft Sentinel** targets integrate with Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM platform for security analysis and monitoring.

- **Azure Blob Storage** targets include Azure Blob Storage for data archiving and Azure Data Explorer for real-time analytics.

- **Azure Data Explorer** targets send data to **Azure Data Explorer** for analytics.

Each target type card shows enabled/disabled counts.

Selecting one of the cards (e.g., _Console_) takes you to the configuration view.

The elements in this view:

- **Search &lt;target-type&gt; targets** text box to filter by name
- **Status filter** dropdown to filter by _All_/_Enabled_/_Disabled_
- **Add new target** button at the top right

The target table has the following columns (for _Console_):

- **Name** - Name given to the target at creation
- **Description** - Descriptive text for the target's purpose
- **Postprocessing Pipeline** - Pipeline used for postprocessing. See <Topic id="normalization">Normalization</Topic> for details
- **Status** - Target is _Enabled_/_Disabled_

The **Actions** drapdown (â‹®) for each target offers the _Edit_, _Clone_, _Enable_/Disable, and _Delete_ options.

Pagination controls navigate through large target inventories.

Items per page offers customizable table display options.
