# Targets: Overview

The **Targets View** provides comprehensive management capabilities for all data output destinations within the **DataStream** platform. This interface enables administrators to configure, monitor, and manage various target types including Azure Sentinel, file outputs, database connections, and cloud storage integrations.

## Overview

The main targets view displays all configured targets with their operational status and key metrics. The centralized interface presents a comprehensive view of all data output destinations, allowing administrators to quickly assess system health and manage target configurations from a single location.

The view provides essential functionality including:

- **Target listing**: Complete overview of all configured targets with type identification
- **Status monitoring**: Real-time operational status for each target connection
- **Quick actions**: Direct access to edit, clone, and delete operations
- **Search capabilities**: Filter targets by name, type, or configuration parameters
- **Performance metrics**: Connection status and throughput indicators

## Target Management Interface

### Table View and Navigation

The targets interface uses a comprehensive table layout for efficient target management. The tabular format organizes targets in rows with dedicated columns for essential information, making it easy to scan through multiple configurations and identify specific targets quickly.

Key interface elements include:

- **Target identification**: Name, type, and description columns for easy recognition
- **Status indicators**: Visual status badges showing connection health
- **Action buttons**: Quick access to edit, clone, and delete functions
- **Pagination controls**: Navigate through large target inventories
- **Items per page**: Customizable table display options

### Search and Filtering

Advanced search capabilities help locate specific targets quickly. The search functionality is positioned prominently within the interface, allowing administrators to filter through large numbers of targets efficiently.

Search features include:

- **Text-based search**: Filter targets by name or configuration properties
- **Real-time filtering**: Instant results as you type search terms
- **Case-insensitive matching**: Flexible search without exact case requirements
- **Multi-field search**: Search across target names, types, and descriptions

### Status-Based Filtering

Filter targets by operational status for focused management. Status filters are available as dropdown options or toggle buttons, allowing administrators to focus on targets that require attention or specific operational states.

Status filtering provides:

- **Connection status filtering**: Show only connected, disconnected, or error state targets
- **Health monitoring**: Focus on targets requiring attention
- **Operational overview**: Quick assessment of system-wide target health
- **Maintenance planning**: Identify targets needing configuration updates

### Target Actions Menu

Each target provides comprehensive management options through an actions menu accessible via a dropdown button or context menu in each target row. This centralized action interface ensures consistent access to management functions across all target types.

Available actions include:

- **Edit target**: Modify configuration, credentials, and connection parameters
- **Clone target**: Duplicate existing configurations for similar setups
- **Delete target**: Remove targets with confirmation safeguards
- **View details**: Access comprehensive target information and logs

## Console Target Example

Console targets provide a specialized interface for development and debugging purposes. The console target configuration displays real-time data output in a readable format, making it an invaluable tool for pipeline development and troubleshooting.

Console targets provide:

- **Real-time monitoring**: Live data stream display for debugging
- **Development support**: Immediate feedback during pipeline development
- **Format validation**: Verify output formatting before production deployment
- **Performance testing**: Monitor throughput and processing efficiency

The targets view provides comprehensive control over data output destinations, ensuring reliable and efficient data delivery across diverse target systems while maintaining security and operational excellence.
