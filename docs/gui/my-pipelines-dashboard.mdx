# My Pipelines Dashboard

This is the working area where you create, monitor, and manage your pipelines.

## Filtering

As can be seen, on the left-hand side there are tools for managing your pipelines:

<img src={MyPipelinesFilteringSearchBoxMarked} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

You can use the **Search pipeline** box to type the name of your pipeline and search for it. You can use the drop-down list box to select multiple pipelines grouped under the listed categories. Its default is **All** pipelines.

If there are no pipelines matching your criteria, or if you have not created any pipelines yet, the panel under the search box will show a **No pipelines found** message.

### Enhanced Filtering Options

<img src={MyPipelinesFiltering} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="My pipelines filtering options"/>

The filtering interface provides comprehensive pipeline management capabilities:

- **Search Box**: Type pipeline names for quick location
- **Category Filters**: Group pipelines by type, status, or vendor
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter by creation date, last modification, or target destination
- **Clear Filters**: Reset all filtering criteria to show all pipelines

## Table View

Clicking on the right button on the far right side switches the screen to table view.

<img src={MyPipelinesTableViewButtonMarked} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

The table view looks like this:

<img src={MyPipelinesTableView} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="My pipelines table view"/>

In this view, you can monitor your pipelines based on the following:

- **Name** - the name of the pipeline
- **Device Type** - the device type that the pipeline is receiving data from
- **Device Vendor** - vendor of the device. See <Topic id="gui-content-hub">Content Hub</Topic> for examples
- **Target** - the target that the output of the pipeline will be directed to. See <Topic id="gui-content-hub">Content Hub</Topic> for examples
- **Last Updated** - date of last modification made to the pipeline
- **Created** - date of creation of the pipeline

### Alternative View Modes

<img src={MyPipelinesFullListTableView} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="My pipelines full list table view"/>

The interface supports multiple viewing modes for pipeline management:

- **Table View**: Organized rows and columns for detailed pipeline information
- **Card View**: Visual cards showing pipeline summaries and status
- **List View**: Compact listing format for quick pipeline identification

To create a new pipeline, click the **Create new pipeline** button. This will take you to the <Topic id="gui-new-pipeline">Create New Pipeline</Topic> screen.

## Pipeline Management

You can also manage existing pipelines:

### Deleting Pipelines

Pipeline deletion requires careful consideration due to the impact on data processing workflows. The system provides detailed information before allowing deletion.

<img src={MyPipelinesDeleteDetails} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Pipeline delete details"/>

The delete details view shows:

- **Pipeline Information**: Name, description, and current configuration
- **Impact Assessment**: Connected targets and dependent processes
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Current data routes and processing status
- **Confirmation Requirements**: Security verification before deletion

<img src={MyPipelinesDelete} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Pipeline delete confirmation"/>

The deletion confirmation includes:

- **Final Confirmation**: Type the pipeline name to confirm deletion intent
- **Warning Messages**: Clear indication of permanent removal
- **Alternative Actions**: Options to disable rather than delete
- **Backup Recommendations**: Suggestions to export configuration before deletion

:::warning
Pipeline deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Ensure you have exported any necessary configurations before proceeding with deletion.
