# Manage Users

The **Manage Users** interface allows administrators to control user accounts, permissions, and access within the **DataStream** platform. This comprehensive user management system provides the ability to create, edit, disable, and monitor user accounts across your organization.

## User Overview Dashboard

The main users dashboard displays all registered users in your organization with their essential information:

<Image id="manage-users" width="100%" alt="Manage users overview"/>

The dashboard contains the following key elements:

- **Search users**: Text field to quickly find specific users by name or email
- **Status filter**: Dropdown to filter users by status (All, Active, Passive)
- **Add new user**: Blue button to create new user accounts
- **User table**: Displays Full Name, Email, User Role, and Status for each user
- **Items per page**: Controls pagination settings (10, 25, 50 items)
- **Page navigation**: Shows current page and total pages

## Adding New Users

To create a new user account, click the **Add new user** button to access the user creation form:

<Image id="manage-users-add-new-user" width="75%" alt="Manage users add new user"/>

### User Details Section

Complete the following required fields:

- **Full name**: Enter the user's complete name
- **User email**: Provide a valid email address (this will be the login credential)
- **Password**: Set an initial password for the user
- **Confirm password**: Re-enter the password to verify accuracy

### Regional Settings

Configure user preferences:

- **Timezone preference**: Select the appropriate timezone from the dropdown (e.g., GMT+03:00 Istanbul, Ankara, Ä°zmir, Bursa, Adana)
- **Language**: Set the interface language (English by default)

### Role Assignment

Choose the appropriate user role and permissions:

- **User (Read only)**: Grants read-only permissions to users. Recommended for users who are not intended to make changes and/or deletions within the organization.
- **Admin**: Grants edit and delete permissions to users. Recommended for users who are entitled and responsible to do such actions across the organization.

The role selection determines what actions the user can perform within the platform. Admin users have full access to modify configurations, while Read-only users can only view data and dashboards.

Click **Add user** to create the account or **Cancel** to discard the configuration.

## User List with Success Notification

After successfully adding a user, you'll see a confirmation notification:

<Image id="manage-users-list" width="100%" alt="Manage users list view"/>

The green notification banner confirms "New user added - New user has successfully been added." The new user will appear in the user list with their assigned role and active status.

## Status Filtering

Use the status filter to view users by their current status:

<Image id="manage-users-active-passive-filter" width="100%" alt="Manage users active passive filter"/>

The status dropdown allows filtering by:
- **All**: Display all users regardless of status
- **Active**: Show only currently active users
- **Passive**: Show only disabled/inactive users

## Search Functionality

Quickly locate specific users using the search feature:

<Image id="manage-users-search" width="100%" alt="Manage users search interface"/>

The search field provides real-time filtering as you type, searching across user names and email addresses.

## User Management Actions

### Disabling Users

When you disable a user, the system displays a confirmation notification:

<Image id="manage-users-disabled-notification" width="100%" alt="Manage users disabled notification"/>

The notification shows "User disabled - User has successfully been disabled." Disabled users appear with a "Passive" status in the user list and cannot access the platform until re-enabled.

### Required Field Validation

The system enforces required field validation during user creation:

<Image id="manage-users-required-fields" width="100%" alt="Manage users required fields"/>

Missing or invalid fields are highlighted to ensure complete user information before account creation.

### Disable and Delete Options

For user account management, the interface provides disable and delete options:

<Image id="manage-users-disable-delete" width="100%" alt="Manage users disable delete options"/>

Use these options carefully:
- **Disable**: Temporarily restricts user access while preserving account data
- **Delete**: Permanently removes the user account and associated data

## User Details and Permissions

Click on any user to access detailed user information and edit permissions:

<Image id="manage-users-permissions" width="100%" alt="Manage users permissions view"/>

The user details page provides:

### User Details Tab

- **Full name**: Editable user name field
- **Role**: Changeable role assignment (Admin/User)
- **User email**: Display of user's email address
- **Password**: Password management with reset option
- **Timezone preference**: Configurable timezone settings

### User Information Panel

- **Status**: Current user status (Active/Passive)

### Password Reset

To reset a user's password, click the **Reset password** link:

<Image id="manage-users-details-edit-reset-password" width="100%" alt="Manage users details edit reset password"/>

This allows administrators to:
- Generate new temporary passwords
- Force password changes on next login
- Maintain account security through proper password management

Use **Save changes** to apply modifications or **Cancel** to discard changes.

### User Deletion

When deleting a user account, the system requires confirmation:

<Image id="manage-users-delete" width="100%" alt="Manage users delete confirmation"/>

The deletion process ensures that administrators understand the permanent nature of this action before proceeding.
