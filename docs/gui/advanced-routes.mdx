Access comprehensive route management actions directly from the table view including edit, clone, delete, and configuration export options.

## Creating Advanced Routes

### Step 1: Basic Configuration

<Image id="advanced-routes-add-new-step1" width="100%" alt="Advanced routes creation step 1 showing initial configuration interface"/>

Begin creating advanced routes with the initial configuration step, where you define basic route parameters and general settings.

<Image id="advanced-routes-add-new-step1-required-fields" width="100%" alt="Advanced routes step 1 highlighting required fields for configuration"/>

Complete all required fields including route name, description, and basic routing parameters before proceeding to advanced configuration options.

### Configuration Details

The configuration panel starts with a blank state, ready for you to define complex routing logic and conditional statements.

<Image id="advanced-routes-add-new-step1-configuration-filled-in" width="100%" alt="Advanced routes configuration panel with complete configuration"/>

Fill in the configuration details including conditional logic, routing rules, and data transformation parameters for sophisticated routing scenarios.

## Route Editing and Management

### Route Editing Workflow

Edit existing routes through the comprehensive editing interface, allowing modification of all routing parameters and conditions.

<Image id="advanced-routes-route-edit-step2" width="100%" alt="Advanced routes edit interface step 2 showing detailed configuration options"/>

Access detailed configuration options in step 2 of the editing process, including advanced conditional logic and routing rule modifications.

<Image id="advanced-routes-route-edit-step2-changed" width="100%" alt="Advanced routes edit interface step 2 with changes highlighted"/>

The interface highlights changes made to routing configurations, providing clear visibility into modifications before applying updates.

### Route Cloning

<Image id="advanced-routes-route-clone" width="100%" alt="Advanced routes clone functionality showing route duplication options"/>

Clone existing routes to quickly create similar configurations, reducing setup time for complex routing scenarios with shared characteristics.

## Route Deletion and Safety

### Deletion Confirmation

Multiple confirmation steps ensure intentional deletion of advanced routing configurations that may impact critical data flows.

## Advanced Routing Features

### Complex Conditional Logic

Advanced routes support sophisticated conditional logic including:

- **Multi-condition Rules**: Combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic
- **Field-based Routing**: Route data based on specific field values and patterns
- **Time-based Conditions**: Implement time-sensitive routing logic
- **Data Type Filtering**: Route based on content type, format, or structure
- **Priority-based Routing**: Define routing priorities for overlapping conditions

### Data Transformation

- **Pre-routing Processing**: Transform data before routing decisions
- **Conditional Transformations**: Apply different processing based on routing paths
- **Field Mapping**: Modify field structures for different target requirements
- **Format Conversion**: Convert data formats based on target specifications

### Performance Optimization

- **Load Balancing**: Distribute data across multiple targets
- **Failover Routing**: Automatic failover for target availability
- **Batch Processing**: Group data for efficient target delivery
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track routing performance and resource usage

### Integration Capabilities

- **Pipeline Integration**: Seamless integration with processing pipelines
- **Target Flexibility**: Support for multiple target types and configurations
- **Source Compatibility**: Compatible with all device types and data sources
- **Monitoring Integration**: Built-in monitoring and alerting for route health

Advanced routes provide the flexibility and power needed for enterprise-scale data routing scenarios while maintaining clear configuration management through the comprehensive interface.
