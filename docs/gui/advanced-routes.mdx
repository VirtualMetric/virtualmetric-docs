# Advanced Routes

Advanced routes provide detailed configuration options for complex data routing scenarios. This interface allows you to define sophisticated routing logic, conditional rules, and data transformation paths for your pipelines.

## Configuration Interface

The advanced routes interface provides comprehensive routing management capabilities:

### Left Navigation Panel

The sidebar displays the routing hierarchy and available configuration options:

- **Route Management**: View and organize existing routing configurations
- **Configuration Tree**: Navigate through complex routing structures
- **Add Route Options**: Create new routing rules and conditions

### Main Configuration Area

The central panel provides detailed routing configuration options:

### Route Definition Section

- **Route Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the routing rule
- **Condition Logic**: Define the conditional statements that determine when this route is triggered
- **Target Selection**: Specify the destination pipeline or target for data matching this route

### Advanced Settings

- **Priority Level**: Set the evaluation order for multiple routing rules
- **Fallback Options**: Configure alternative routes when primary conditions are not met
- **Data Transformation**: Apply processing rules before routing data to the target

### Action Controls

- **Save Route**: Apply the current routing configuration
- **Test Route**: Validate routing logic with sample data
- **Delete Route**: Remove the selected routing rule
- **Export Configuration**: Save routing settings for backup or replication

## Route Configuration Workflow

1. **Route Planning**: Design the routing logic and identify data flow requirements
2. **Condition Setup**: Define the conditional logic that determines routing decisions
3. **Target Configuration**: Specify destination pipelines or targets for each route
4. **Testing**: Validate routing behavior with test data
5. **Deployment**: Activate the routing configuration for production use

The advanced routing system enables complex data processing scenarios while maintaining clear configuration management through the structured interface.
