# Content Hub

:::info
**Content Hub** is a centralized platform within **Microsoft Sentinel** that allows teams to discover, deploy, and manage out-of-the-box (OOTB) content and solutions to enhance their operations.
:::

The **Content Hub** is **DataStream**'s centralized repository for pre-built data processing templates and integrations. It provides ready-to-use pipeline templates that help you quickly set up data collection, processing, and monitoring for various platforms and services.

This is the working area where you manage your **Content Hub**-related assets.

<img src={ContentHubFull} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Content Hub full view"/>

<img src={ContentHubUpperPart} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

The content provided here are preconfigured solutions with specific features that **VirtualMetric** offers.

Browse and discover a wide range of templates, ready to use - allowing users to rapidly deploy proven data pipeline configurations without starting from scratch.

<img src={ContentHubMiddlePart} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Content Hub middle section"/>

The middle section displays available content templates with detailed information cards showing:

- **Template Names**: Clear identification of each available solution
- **Vendor Information**: Source organization or technology provider
- **Template Categories**: Classification by function (Security, Network, Microsoft, etc.)
- **Installation Status**: Visual indicators showing which templates are already deployed

## Content Organization Views

The Content Hub provides multiple ways to view and organize available templates:

### Accessed Content Tabs

<img src={ContentHubAccessedContentTab1} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Content Hub accessed content tab 1"/>

The first tab displays recently accessed or featured content templates, showing the most commonly used solutions.

<img src={ContentHubAccessedContentTab2} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Content Hub accessed content tab 2"/>

The second tab organizes content by specific categories or vendor classifications.

<img src={ContentHubAccessedContentTab3} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Content Hub accessed content tab 3"/>

The third tab shows additional content views, including specialized templates and advanced configurations.

### Installed Content Management

<img src={ContentHubInstalledContent} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Content Hub installed content"/>

The installed content view displays:

- **Deployed Templates**: Complete list of currently installed pipeline templates
- **Installation Dates**: When each template was deployed to your environment
- **Template Status**: Active status and health indicators for installed content
- **Management Options**: Update, modify, or remove installed templates

## Filtering the Content

You can filter the content here based on:

- **Devices**:

  On left-hand side panel, under the **Device Type** drop-down list, click **Windows**. The selected device type will be moved to the place of the drow-down list.

  <img src={ContentHubWindowsDeviceSelected} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

  The content in the viewing area will be filtered to display only solutions based on the **Windows** device type.

  Clicking on the &#128473; on the right side of the selected device type  removes the filter and exposes the **Device Type** drop-down list again.

  :::note
  Clicking on the drop-down lists folds them to make room for the items below them.
  :::

- **Targets**:

  On the left-hand side panel, under the **Target** drop-down list, tick the checkbox of **Elasticsearch**.

  <img src={ContentHubElasticsearchTargetSelected} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

  The content in the viewing area will be filtered to display only solutions with **Elasticsearch** as their target.

  Unticking the checkbox removes the filter.

- **Device Vendors**:

  On the left-hand side panel, under the **Device vendor** drop-down list, tick the checkbox of **Fortinet**.

  <img src={ContentHubFortinetDeviceVendorSelected} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

  The content in the viewing area will be filtered to display only solutions with **Fortinet** as their device vendor.

  Unticking the checkbox removes the filter.

## Accessing the Content

In the viewing area, the content access panes display prominent features of the content. The following solution, for example, indicates that it has **Microsoft Sentinel** integration.

<img src={ContentHubAccessPane} style={{maxWidth: "50%"}} />

To access the content, all you have to do is to click on its pane. This will take you to the **Details** view.

<img src={ContentHubZscalerContentDisplayedMarked} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

### Detailed Content View

<img src={ContentHubZscalerContentDisplayed} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Zscaler content detailed view"/>

In the detailed view, there will be general information about the solution:

- **Left Panel**: Comprehensive description of what the pipeline does, what inputs it can handle, what outputs are to be expected, and implementation requirements
- **Right Panel**: Summary of the pipeline's technical details such as its device type and target, its device vendor, which processors are used with links to their documentation

### Enhanced Content Presentation

<img src={ContentHubZscakerPageFull} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Zscaler content full page view"/>

The full page view provides complete details about the selected template including:

- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for deployment
- **Configuration Requirements**: Prerequisites and system requirements
- **Integration Details**: How the template connects with existing infrastructure
- **Documentation Links**: Access to related configuration guides and best practices

To see the whole list of processors used by the pipelin, click the **See all processors** drop-down list button.

:::info Installing the Solution
To install the pipeline solution, click the top right button **Install this pipeline template**. Once the solution (in our example **Zscaler ZIA Pack**) is installed, you will see the following summary:

<img src={ContentHubZscalerContentInstalled} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />
:::

When installing content with dependencies, you may see a modal like this:

<img src={ContentHubDownloadDependencyModal} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Download dependency modal"/>

### Installation Restrictions

You may encounter restrictions when attempting to install content that has already been deployed:

<img src={ContentHubCannotDownloadTwice1} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Cannot download twice - first view"/>

The system prevents duplicate installations to maintain content integrity. When you attempt to install content that is already present, you'll see a notification indicating that the content is already installed.

<img src={ContentHubCannotDownloadTwice2} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} alt="Cannot download twice - second view"/>

This protection mechanism ensures:

- **Content Integrity**: Prevents conflicts from duplicate installations
- **System Stability**: Maintains consistent pipeline configurations
- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoids redundant content storage
