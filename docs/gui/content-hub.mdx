# Content Hub

:::info
**Content Hub** is a centralized platform within **Microsoft Sentinel** that allows teams to discover, deploy, and manage out-of-the-box (OOTB) content and solutions to enhance their operations.
:::

This is the working area where you manage your **Content Hub**-related assets.

The content provided here are preconfigured solutions with specific features that **VirtualMetric** offers.

## Filtering the Content

You can filter the content here based on:

- **Devices**:

  On left-hand side panel, under the **Device Type** drop-down list, click **Windows**. The selected device type will be moved to the place of the drow-down list.

  <img src={ContentHubWindowsDeviceSelected} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

  The content in the viewing area will be filtered to display only solutions based on the **Windows** device type.

  Clicking on the &#128473; on the right side of the selected device type  removes the filter and exposes the **Device Type** drop-down list again.

  :::note
  Clicking on the drop-down lists folds them to make room for the items below them.
  :::

- **Targets**:

  On the left-hand side panel, under the **Target** drop-down list, tick the checkbox of **Elasticsearch**.

  <img src={ContentHubElasticsearchTargetSelected} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

  The content in the viewing area will be filtered to display only solutions with **Elasticsearch** as their target.

  Unticking the checkbox removes the filter.

- **Device Vendors**:

  On the left-hand side panel, under the **Device vendor** drop-down list, tick the checkbox of **Fortinet**.

  <img src={ContentHubFortinetDeviceVendorSelected} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

  The content in the viewing area will be filtered to display only solutions with **Fortinet** as their device vendor.

  Unticking the checkbox removes the filter.

## Accessing the Content

In the viewing area, the content access panes display prominent features of the content. The following solution, for example, indicates that it has **Microsoft Sentinel** integration.

To access the content, all you have to do is to click on its pane. This will take you to the **Details** view.

<img src={ContentHubZscalerContentDisplayedMarked} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

In this view, there will be general information about the solution:

- On the such as what the pipeline does, what inputs it can handle, what outputs are to be expected, etc.

- On the right-hand side, there will be a summary of the pipeline's technical details such as its device type and target, its device vendor, which processors are used with links to their documentation.

To see the whole list of processors used by the pipelin, click the **See all processors** drop-down list button.

:::info Installing the Solution
To install the pipeline solution, click the top right button **Install this pipeline template**. Once the solution (in our example **Zscaler ZIA Pack**) is installed, you will see the following summary:
