# My Pipelines Screen

This is the working area where you create, monitor, and manage your pipelines.

## Filtering

As can be seen, on the left-hand side there are tools for managing your pipelines:

<img src={MyPipelinesFilteringSearchBoxMarked} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

You can use the **Search pipeline** box to type the name of your pipeline and search for it. You can use the drop-down list box to select multiple pipelines grouped under the listed categories. Its default is **All** pipelines.

If there are no pipelines matching your criteria, or if you have not created any pipelines yet, the panel under the search box will show a **No pipelines found** message.

## Table View

Clicking on the right button on the far right side switches the screen to table view.

In this view, you can monitor your pipelines based on the following:

- **Name** - the name of the pipeline
- **Device Type** - the device type that the pipeline is receiving data from
- **Device Vendor** - vendor of the device. See <Topic id="gui-content-hub">Content Hub</Topic> for examples
- **Target** - the target that the output of the pipeline will be directed to. See <Topic id="gui-content-hub">Content Hub</Topic> for examples
- **Last Updated** - date of last modification made to the pipeline
- **Created** - date of creation of the pipeline

To create a new pipeline, click the **Create new pipeline** button. This will take you to the <Topic id="gui-new-pipeline">Create New Pipeline</Topic> screen.
