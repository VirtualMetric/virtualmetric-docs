# My Pipelines: Overview

The **My Pipelines** view displays your created or installed pipelines.

## Views

At the top left, there is a **Create new pipeline** button for adding new pipelines.
Under it, there are two buttons that allow you to switch between the card view and the table view.

By default the card view is selected.

Under the main header, there is **Search pipelines** box you can use to search for pipelines by name.

Next to it is a dropdown to filter the view by pipeline category. By default **All** is selected.

### Card View

In this view, each pipeline card shows the pipeline name, the description that explains what it was designed for, and basic information about its configuration.

The three black labels on a card indicate the **Device Type**, **Device Vendor**, and **Target** of the pipeline.

Finally, you can also see their timestamps with the **Last updated at** and **Created at** fields.

Clicking on a card takes you to the [**Details**](#details-view) view.

### Table View

In this view, the pipelines appear in a structured table format with columns for different pipeline properties.

The columns of the table:

- **Name** - Unique name of the pipeline
- **Device Type** - The device attached to the pipeline for data ingestion
- **Device Vendor** - Vendor of the device
- **Target** - The target attached to the pipeline to forward data
- **Last Updated** - Timestamp for the last saved modification of the pipeline
- **Created** - Timestamp for the pipeline creation

Below the table, you will find:

- **Items per page** - Dropdown to select the number of rows displayed per page
- **Page selector** - Dropdown to navigate directly to a specific page

Next to each row is a vertical ellipsis (&#x22EE;) that opens the **Actions** dropdown. Available options are _Edit pipeline details_ and _Delete pipeline_.

Selecting **Edit pipeline details** from the dropdown takes you to the [**Details**](#details-view) view.

## Details View

In this view, you can find much more detailed information on the pipeline.
