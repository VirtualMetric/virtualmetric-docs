## General Information

### Template Details

- **Name**: Zscaler ZTA Pack for Microsoft Sentinel
- **Description**: Comprehensive ASIM normalization parser pack for Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) cloud security platform

### Device Information

- **Device Type**: Cloud Security
- **Device Vendor**: Zscaler
- **Target Platform**: Microsoft Sentinel

## Functionality

### Core Capabilities

**Log Processing**: This parser pack processes Common Security Log (CSL) formatted messages from Zscaler ZIA services and transforms them into Microsoft Sentinel's standardized ASIM schemas including NetworkSession, WebSession, and DnsActivity.

**Intelligent Routing**: The pack intelligently routes and parses Zscaler ZIA logs based on DeviceProduct identifiers to extract:

- Network session information
- Web traffic details
- DNS query activities

### Log Type Support

The template handles three distinct ZIA log types:

1. **nssfwlog** - Firewall/network sessions
2. **nssweblog** - Web proxy sessions
3. **nssdnslog** - DNS resolution activities

### Advanced Features

**Threat Intelligence Integration**: The parser supports DNS field mappings for Zscaler-specific extensions including:

- Threat risk levels
- Content categories
- Policy actions
- User context information

**Security Analytics**: Key features include:

- Automatic log type classification
- Intelligent action mapping (Allow/Deny/Drop/Reset)
- Threat severity assessment based on risk levels
- Comprehensive user and application tracking
- Detailed session monitoring and policy analysis

**Advanced Parsing**: The parser supports sophisticated fields such as:

- Department information
- NAT translation details
- Content filtering results
- Threat intelligence data
- Policy enforcement outcomes
- Sophisticated message parsing for security events, content inspection results, and policy violations

### Data Optimization

**Performance Features**:

- Threat-based filtering capabilities
- Automatic schema enforcement
- Seamless integration with Microsoft Sentinel's security analytics

**Parser Compatibility**:

- NetworkSession parser: Handles firewall logs with action mapping for Allow/Block/Drop/Reset scenarios
- WebSession parser: Processes proxy logs with content categorization and threat assessment
- DnsActivity parser: Manages DNS queries with response analysis and threat detection

**Schema Support**: Fully compatible with Microsoft Sentinel's ASIM schemas:

- NetworkSession schema version 0.2.1
- WebSession schema version 0.2.3
- DnsActivity schema version 0.1.3

## Processors Used (23)

The template utilizes 23 different processors for comprehensive data transformation:

### Available Processors

- **Lowercase** - Text normalization for consistent data formatting
- **Urldecode** - URL decoding for proper web traffic analysis
- **Slice** - Data extraction and segmentation
- **Take** - Data selection and filtering
- **Split** - Data parsing and field separation

### Documentation Access

Each processor includes direct links to documentation ("See Docs") for detailed configuration and usage information.
