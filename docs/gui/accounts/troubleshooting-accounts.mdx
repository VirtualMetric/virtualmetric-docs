# Troubleshooting Accounts

This guide addresses common issues and problems that may occur when managing account settings in DataStream. Use this troubleshooting reference to quickly resolve account-related problems and maintain smooth platform operation.

## Common Issues

### Edit Button Clicks But Changes Won't Save

**Problem:** You click the edit button and make changes, but the changes don't persist after saving.

**Solution:**
- Check internet connection stability
- Verify you have edit permissions for your account
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try a different browser or incognito/private mode
- Check for system maintenance notifications
- Log out and log back in to refresh session

### New Email Address is Rejected

**Problem:** System rejects your new email address during profile updates.

**Solution:**
- Ensure email format is valid (contains @ and proper domain)
- Check if email is already in use by another account
- Verify domain is allowed by your organization's policies
- Confirm no typos in the email address
- Contact your administrator for restricted domains
- Try using a different email provider if corporate restrictions apply

### New Password is Not Accepted

**Problem:** Your new password doesn't meet system requirements or is rejected.

**Solution:**
- Verify all password requirements are met:
  - Minimum length (typically 8+ characters)
  - Contains uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Includes numbers and special characters
  - Doesn't contain dictionary words
- Ensure current password is entered correctly
- Check password isn't too similar to previous passwords
- Avoid using username or email in password
- Try a completely different password pattern
- Contact administrator if password policy is unclear

### Selected Theme Doesn't Change Interface

**Problem:** You select a different theme but the interface appearance doesn't change.

**Solution:**
- Refresh the browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- Clear browser cache and cookies completely
- Check browser compatibility with the selected theme
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere
- Log out and back in to refresh the session
- Try a different browser to isolate the issue
- Check if theme changes require administrator approval

### Times Appear Off Despite Correct Timezone

**Problem:** Timestamps and times display incorrectly even after setting the correct timezone.

**Solution:**
- Verify timezone selection includes your specific city/region
- Check for Daylight Saving Time (DST) issues
- Ensure your system time is synchronized
- Review date/time format settings in preferences
- Contact support for timezone database updates
- Clear browser cache which may store old timezone data

## Browser-Specific Issues

### Chrome/Chromium Issues
- **Autofill conflicts**: Disable autofill for password fields if causing issues

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Session-Related Problems
