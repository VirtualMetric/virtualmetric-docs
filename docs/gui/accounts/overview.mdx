# Accounts: Overview

The **Account Settings** page in **DataStream** allows you to personalize your user experience and manage your account credentials. These settings affect how you interact with the platform, including display preferences, regional settings, and security configurations.

## Access

- Go to the **Welcome View** by logging in with your credentials
- Click your profile icon on the top right corner to open the profile menu
- Click the **Account Settings** link from the dropdown menu

Here, you can edit and adjust the following:

- Personal information
- Locale settings for language, timezone, and date formats
- Display preferences to customize the interface appearance
- Security settings to manage your password and authentication

The Account Settings page is organized into three main sections:

## Profile Settings

This section contains your basic account information. Each field can be edited by clicking the **Edit** link next to the field.

### Email Address

Primary contact method for system notifications. Can be used for account recovery and password reset, and to set the login credential (in most configurations).

### Full Name

Display name throughout the **DataStream** interface. Appears in user activity logs, report signatures, collaboration features, and audit trails.

### Title

Professional designation or role. Displayed in user profiles, report headers, email signatures (if configured), and team directories.

## Preferences

This section allows you to customize how DataStream displays information and interacts with you. These settings are user-specific and don't affect other users.

### Display Language

Available language options for the interface. Changes take effect immediately.

### Timezone

Ensures accurate timestamp display. Affects log entry timestamps, scheduled report execution, alert triggering times, historical data viewing, and meeting scheduling.

## Security

Manage your account password and authentication settings for secure access to the platform.
