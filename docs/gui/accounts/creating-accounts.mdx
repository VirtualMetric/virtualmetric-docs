# Creating Accounts

To create a user account, you have to navigate to the [account creation page](https://app.dev.virtualmetric.com/) where you will find the account creation form.

- Make sure the credentials you enter—your email address, your company name, etc.—are valid.
- Enter a strong password at least 8 characters long, containing a mixture of capital and small letters, numbers, and special characters. If the password is weak, it will be rejected and you will be asked to try a stronger one.

After filling in the required fields indicated, click the **Create Account** button to finish creating an account. You will be taken to the <Topic id="gui-welcome">**Welcome Dashboard**</Topic>.

Once you have created an account and logged out, you can use our [login page](https://app.eu-west.cloud.virtualmetric.com/login) to access your account anytime. Make sure to enter your credentials correctly to avoid getting an error.
