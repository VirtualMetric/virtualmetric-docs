# Creating Accounts

To create a user account, navigate to the [account creation page](https://app.dev.virtualmetric.com/) where you will find the account creation form.

The account creation form includes the following fields:

- **Email Address**: Enter a valid email address that will be used for your account
- **Company Name**: Provide your company or organization name
- **Password**: Create a strong password following the security requirements
- **Additional Required Fields**: Complete any other mandatory information as indicated

## Account Creation Requirements

- Make sure the credentials you enter—your email address, your company name, etc.—are valid.
- Enter a strong password at least 8 characters long, containing a mixture of capital and small letters, numbers, and special characters. If the password is weak, it will be rejected and you will be asked to try a stronger one.

After filling in all required fields, click the **Create Account** button to finish creating an account. You will be taken to the <Topic id="gui-welcome">**Welcome View**</Topic>.

## Logging Into Your Account

Once you have created an account and logged out, you can use our [login page](https://app.eu-west.cloud.virtualmetric.com/login) to access your account anytime. Make sure to enter your credentials correctly to avoid authentication errors. If you enter incorrect login credentials, the system will display an error message indicating that your email address or password is incorrect.

## Password Reset

If you forget your password, you can reset it using the password reset functionality accessible from the login page.

### Starting the Reset Process

To initiate password reset:

- Click the **Forgot Password?** link on the login page
- This will redirect you to the password reset form
- The form requires only your registered email address

The password reset page displays a simple form with a field for your email address and options to either send the reset link or return to the login page.

### Email Address Verification

In the password reset form:

- **Email Address**: Enter the email address associated with your account
- **Send Reset Link**: Click to send the password reset email to your address
- **Back to Login**: Return to the login page if you remember your password

### Confirmation Process

After submitting your email address:

- **Confirmation Message**: The system displays confirmation that the reset email was sent
- **Email Delivery**: Check your email inbox (including spam folder) for the reset message
- **Time Limit**: The reset link expires after a specific time period for security

The confirmation page will show a message indicating that a password reset email has been sent to your address, with instructions to check your email.

### Completing Password Reset

When you click the reset link in your email, you will be taken to a new password form where you can:

- **New Password Form**: Enter your new password following the strength requirements
- **Password Confirmation**: Re-enter the new password to confirm accuracy
- **Security Requirements**: The new password must meet the same criteria as account creation (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters)
- **Complete Reset**: Submit the form to activate your new password

:::info Security Note
Password reset links are single-use and expire for security purposes. If the link expires, you'll need to request a new reset email.
