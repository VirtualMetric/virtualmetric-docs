# Creating Accounts

To create a user account, you have to navigate to the [**Account Creation Page**](https://app.dev.virtualmetric.com/) where you will find the account creation form.

The form on the **Create your account** page consists of the following fields:

- **Business email** - Primary contact method for system notifications. Used as your username at sign in
- **Set Password** - Set your user password
<Include id="info-password-requirements" />
- **Confirm password** - Re-enter your password to confirm
- **Full name** - Enter you first and last name
- **Company** - Enter the name of your organization

After filling in the required fields indicated, click the **Create Account** button to finish creating an account. You will be taken to the <Topic id="gui-home">**Home**</Topic> view.

Once you have created an account and logged out, you can use our [**Sign In Page**](https://app.eu-west.cloud.virtualmetric.com/login) to access your account anytime.

On the **Sign in** page, make sure to enter your username correctly, and click **Continue**.

The next page will require you to enter your password. Ticking the **Remember Me** checkbox keeps you signed in after you close your browser tab.

Make sure you enter your password correctly, and click **Sign in** to proceed to your **Home** view.

## Password Reset

If you forget your password, you can reset it using the second sign in page. Click the **Forgot password?** link to start the process.

This will redirect you to the password reset form. Use the **New pasword** and **Re-enter password** fields to enter your new password.

Clicking **Continue** will take you to the **Password reset email sent** page. Check you inbox for the mail sent. The email will contain a link that will take you to a page. After you enter your new password in the two boxes and click **Confirm** the reset is complete.
