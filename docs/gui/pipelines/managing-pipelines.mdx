# Managing Pipelines

This is the working area where you create, monitor, and manage your pipelines. The view provides a comprehensive interface for pipeline management with multiple tools and viewing options.

## Filtering

The left-hand side of the view contains tools for managing your pipelines. The filtering section includes a **Search pipeline** box where you can type the name of your pipeline to locate it quickly. Additionally, there's a drop-down list box that allows you to select multiple pipelines grouped under various categories, with **All** pipelines being the default selection.

If there are no pipelines matching your criteria, or if you have not created any pipelines yet, the panel under the search box will display a **No pipelines found** message.

### Enhanced Filtering Options

The filtering interface provides comprehensive pipeline management capabilities through several key features:

- **Search Box**: Type pipeline names for quick location
- **Category Filters**: Group pipelines by type, status, or vendor
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter by creation date, last modification, or target destination
- **Clear Filters**: Reset all filtering criteria to show all pipelines

## Table View

The view offers a table view option that can be accessed by clicking the view toggle button located on the far right side of the interface. The table view provides a structured format for pipeline information display.

In table view, you can monitor your pipelines based on the following columns:

- **Name** - the name of the pipeline
- **Device Type** - the device type that the pipeline is receiving data from
- **Device Vendor** - vendor of the device. See <Topic id="gui-content-hub">Content Hub</Topic> for examples
- **Target** - the target that the output of the pipeline will be directed to. See <Topic id="gui-content-hub">Content Hub</Topic> for examples
- **Last Updated** - date of last modification made to the pipeline
- **Created** - date of creation of the pipeline

### Alternative View Modes

The interface supports multiple viewing modes for pipeline management, allowing you to choose the most suitable format for your workflow:

- **Table View**: Organized rows and columns for detailed pipeline information
- **Card View**: Visual cards showing pipeline summaries and status
- **List View**: Compact listing format for quick pipeline identification

To create a new pipeline, click the **Create new pipeline** button. This will take you to the <Topic id="gui-new-pipeline">Create New Pipeline</Topic> screen.

## Pipeline Management

The view provides comprehensive management capabilities for existing pipelines, allowing you to perform various operations on your pipeline collection.

### Deleting Pipelines

Pipeline deletion requires careful consideration due to the impact on data processing workflows. The system provides detailed information before allowing deletion through a multi-step confirmation process.

The delete details interface presents comprehensive information including:

- **Pipeline Information**: Name, description, and current configuration
- **Impact Assessment**: Connected targets and dependent processes
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Current data routes and processing status
- **Confirmation Requirements**: Security verification before deletion

The deletion confirmation process includes multiple safety measures:

- **Final Confirmation**: Type the pipeline name to confirm deletion intent
- **Warning Messages**: Clear indication of permanent removal
- **Alternative Actions**: Options to disable rather than delete
- **Backup Recommendations**: Suggestions to export configuration before deletion

:::warning
Pipeline deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Ensure you have exported any necessary configurations before proceeding with deletion.
