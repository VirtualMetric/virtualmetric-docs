# Managing Pipelines

This page covers managing existing pipelines in the **Pipelines** section.

## Viewing Pipelines

The main **Pipelines** view displays all your created pipelines in either list or table format.

You can switch between **List View** and **Table View** using the toggle buttons in the top right.

The table view provides a more structured display with columns showing pipeline properties and status information.

## Searching Pipelines

At the top of the pipeline list, there is a **search box** for finding specific pipelines.

The search box includes placeholder text that guides you on what to search for.

You can search by pipeline name or other identifying information.

The search box highlights matches as you type, making it easier to locate the pipeline you need.

## Filtering Options

The interface provides filtering capabilities to narrow down the displayed pipelines.

You can filter pipelines based on their status, device type, or other criteria.

Applied filters are visible in the interface, and you can clear them to return to the full pipeline list.

## Pipeline Actions

Each pipeline in the list includes action buttons for management tasks.

Common actions available include editing, deleting, and viewing pipeline details.

Action buttons are located on the right side of each pipeline entry.

## Deleting Pipelines

To delete a pipeline:

- Click the delete button (trash icon) associated with the pipeline you want to remove
- A confirmation modal appears with a warning message
- The modal displays the name and details of the pipeline being deleted
- Review the information to ensure you're removing the correct pipeline
- Click the **Delete** button in the modal to confirm
- Click **Cancel** to abort the deletion

Once confirmed, the pipeline is permanently removed from your **Pipelines** list.

:::note
If a pipeline is referenced by routes or other pipelines (as a child), deletion may be blocked or can disrupt those references. Review dependencies before deleting.

## Pipeline Details

Clicking on a pipeline name or details button opens the pipeline configuration view.

This view shows all the settings and parameters configured for that pipeline.

From the details view, you can edit the pipeline configuration, add or remove child pipelines, and modify other settings.

## Managing Multiple Pipelines

The table view allows you to select multiple pipelines for bulk operations.

To perform bulk operations:

- Switch to **Table View** if not already active
- Use the selection checkboxes in the leftmost column to select pipelines
- Select individual pipelines by clicking their checkboxes
- Use the header checkbox to select all visible pipelines
- Bulk action buttons appear when one or more pipelines are selected. Available bulk actions include deletion and (when supported) status changes such as enable/disable
