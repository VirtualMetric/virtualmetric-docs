# Creating Pipelines

This page covers the process of creating new pipeline templates in **DataStream**.

## Starting Pipeline Creation

Click the **Create New Pipeline** button in the top left of the **Pipelines** section.

This opens the pipeline creation interface where you configure the new pipeline settings.

## Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline creation form contains several sections for defining the pipeline properties.

You need to fill in basic information about the pipeline including its name and description.

The form includes dropdown menus for selecting **Device type**, **Device vendor**, and **Target** options.

These selections determine how the pipeline will process data and where it will send output.

## Device Type Selection

In the **Device type** dropdown, you can select the type of device this pipeline will handle.

The selection affects which processing options and configurations are available for the pipeline.

## Device Vendor Selection

The **Device vendor** dropdown allows you to specify which vendor's devices this pipeline is designed for.

This selection helps optimize the pipeline for vendor-specific log formats and data structures.

## Target Configuration

In the **Target** dropdown, you select where the processed data will be sent.

This determines the output destination and format requirements for the pipeline.

## Child Pipelines

The interface allows you to add child pipelines to create more complex processing workflows.

### Adding Child Pipelines

To add a child pipeline:

- Click the **Add** button in the child pipelines section
- A modal window opens with a text field for the child pipeline name
- Enter the desired name in the input field
- Click the **Add Child Pipeline** button to create it
- Click **Cancel** to close the modal without adding

### Managing Child Pipelines

Each child pipeline appears in the list with:

- The child pipeline name on the left
- An edit (pencil) icon for modifications
- A delete (trash) icon for removal

To delete a child pipeline:

- Click the delete (trash) icon next to the child pipeline
- A confirmation modal appears asking you to confirm the deletion
- Click the confirmation button to permanently remove the child pipeline

## Pipeline Details

The **Details** section shows additional information about the pipeline configuration.

You can enter specific settings and parameters that control how the pipeline processes data.

## Edit Mode

The interface includes an **Edit** mode that allows you to modify pipeline settings after creation.

When you enter edit mode:

- The interface switches to an editable state with form fields
- Input fields become active for modification
- **Save** and **Cancel** buttons appear at the bottom
- You can update the pipeline name, device settings, target configuration, and child pipeline details

To save changes in edit mode:

- Make your desired modifications to the pipeline settings
- Click the **Save** button to apply changes
- Click **Cancel** to discard changes and return to view mode

## Saving New Pipelines

When creating a new pipeline, complete these steps:

- Fill in all required fields (pipeline name, device type, device vendor, target)
- Configure any child pipelines if needed
- Click the **Save** button to create the pipeline
- The saved pipeline will appear in your **Pipelines** list and be available for use
