# Pipelines: Overview

The **Pipelines** section displays your created pipeline templates in a list or table view.

At the top left, there is a **Create New Pipeline** button for adding new pipelines.

On the right side of the header, you can switch between **List View** and **Table View** using the view toggle buttons.

The **Table View** button is specifically marked and highlighted when table view is active.

## Search and Filtering

At the top of the main area, there is a **search box** where you can search for pipelines by name.

The search box includes placeholder text to guide users on what they can search for.

## Pipeline Display

Pipelines are displayed as cards in the main viewing area when in list view.

Each pipeline card shows the pipeline name and basic information about its configuration.

When you switch to table view, the pipelines appear in a structured table format with columns for different pipeline properties.

## Pipeline Actions

Each pipeline card or table row includes action options for managing the pipeline.

You can access editing, deletion, and other management functions directly from the pipeline display area.
