# Managing Templates

This page covers installing templates from the **Content Hub** and managing them after installation.

## Installation Process

Templates are installed using the **Install pipeline template** button located on the top right of the **Template Details** page.

If the template contains dependencies, a modal window appears notifying you that the pipeline has dependencies.

### Dependencies Modal

The dependencies modal displays two distinct sections:

- **Required dependencies**: These are automatically included and cannot be deselected
- **Optional dependencies**: These appear with checkboxes that you can select or deselect

To manage optional dependencies:

- Review the list of optional dependencies shown in the modal
- Check the boxes next to the optional dependencies you want to include
- Leave unchecked any optional dependencies you don't need
- Click **Install** to proceed with your selections
- Click **Cancel** to abort the installation process

## After Installation

When you click the installation button, the view navigates to the **Pipelines** section of the GUI.

The installed template's name is displayed at the top of this view.

You can now modify the downloaded template's pipeline and child pipeline details.

## Editing Installed Templates

The installed template view contains two tabs for editing purposes.

The **General Overview** tab displays general information and pipeline information.

You can edit the general settings of the template by clicking the **Edit** link with the pencil icon on the right side of the **General Info** section.

The editable settings include **Name**, **Device type**, **Device vendor**, and **Target**.

The **Pipeline Overview** tab shows the pipeline name on the left sidebar.

Child pipelines appear as selectable items on the left sidebar, each with edit (pencil) and delete (trash) icons.

At the bottom right, there is a **Save changes on the selected pipeline** blue button.

The left sidebar also contains an **Add new child pipeline** button.

## Managing Child Pipelines

Clicking **Add new child pipeline** opens a modal window with a field to enter the child pipeline name.

The modal contains a **Cancel** button and an **Add child pipeline** button.

Clicking the delete (trash) icon brings up a confirmation modal before removing a child pipeline.

There is also an **Actions** dropdown menu containing **Add child pipeline** and **Delete entire pipeline** options.

The **Delete entire pipeline** option removes the master pipeline and the entire template.

## Installation Status

Once a template is installed, it displays an **installed** label in the main Content Hub view.

When you click an installed template, the **Install pipeline template** button changes to **See installed pipeline**.

### Installation Prevention

Installed templates cannot be installed again. If you attempt to install a template that is already installed:

- A modal window appears with an error message
- The modal explains that the content is already installed
- The modal provides information about the existing installation
- You must click **OK** or **Cancel** to close the error modal
- The system prevents duplicate installations to maintain content integrity

### Managing Installed Content

Installed templates are visually distinguished from available templates:

- Template cards show an **installed** label or indicator
- The installation button text changes to **See installed pipeline**
- Installed templates appear in a dedicated installed content section
- You can access installed templates to view their current configuration
