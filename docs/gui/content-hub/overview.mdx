# Content Hub: Overview

The **Content Hub** page is organized into distinct upper, middle, and lower sections with clear visual divisions.

On the left, there is a sidebar where you can filter the content based on **Device type**, **Target**, and **Device vendor**.

These categories can be used to filter the content you see on the viewing area.

## Filtering Behavior

**Device type** is single select, whereas multiple items can be ticked for **Target** and **Device vendor**.

When you select a filter:

- The selected item becomes highlighted with visual feedback
- Count indicators show how many templates match each filter option
- The main viewing area updates to show only matching templates
- Selected filters remain visible with clear selection states

To clear a device type filter, click the **X** next to the selected device type.

For multi-select filters (**Target** and **Device vendor**), uncheck the items to remove them from the filter.

## Search and Display

At the top of the page, there is a **search field** where you can search for templates by name.

The main viewing area displays template cards arranged in a grid layout.

Each template card shows the template name, basic information about what it contains, and visual indicators for installation status.

## Templates

The templates displayed on this page are prepared by **VirtualMetric**.

They contain pipelines designed to receive logs from various device types and vendors, parse those logs to extract data, and transform and enrich the extracted data.

Users cannot directly modify these templates from this view.

To edit a template, users must first download and install it.

When downloaded, the template content becomes recognized as a pipeline by **DataStream**.

## Accessing Templates

Clicking on a template card takes you to the **Template Details** page.

This page contains three tabs that display different aspects of the selected template.

The **General Overview** tab shows general information on the left side and device information on the right side.

On the right side, you can also see the processors used in the template, with a **See Docs** link for each processor, and a **See all processors** link at the bottom.

The **Pipeline Overview** tab displays the pipeline name on the left sidebar.

If the parent pipeline uses child pipelines, these appear as selectable options in the main area.

The pipelines included in this template are shown, but the pipeline content is read-only and cannot be edited.

The **Log Transformation Overview** tab shows a list of selectable examples on the left sidebar under **Examples**.

In the main area, there is a **Raw Data** box containing sample data, which is read-only.

Below that is the **Log Transformed** section showing the output of the pipeline from the sample data, which is also read-only.

Users cannot test the pipeline by replacing the data in the **Raw Data** box.
