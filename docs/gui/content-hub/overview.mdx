# Content Hub Overview

:::info
**Content Hub** is a centralized platform within **Microsoft Sentinel** that allows teams to discover, deploy, and manage out-of-the-box (OOTB) content and solutions to enhance their operations.
:::

The **Content Hub** is **DataStream**'s centralized repository for pre-built data processing templates and integrations. It provides ready-to-use pipeline templates that help you quickly set up data collection, processing, and monitoring for various platforms and services.

This is the working area where you manage your **Content Hub**-related assets. The interface is organized into several distinct sections to help you efficiently browse, filter, and deploy templates.

The upper section contains navigation controls and filtering options, while the main content area displays preconfigured solutions with specific features that **VirtualMetric** offers.

Browse and discover a wide range of templates, ready to use - allowing users to rapidly deploy proven data pipeline configurations without starting from scratch.

The content display area presents available templates as detailed information cards showing:

- **Template Names**: Clear identification of each available solution
- **Vendor Information**: Source organization or technology provider
- **Template Categories**: Classification by function (Security, Network, Microsoft, etc.)
- **Installation Status**: Indicators showing which templates are already deployed

## Content Organization Views

The Content Hub provides multiple ways to view and organize available templates:

### Accessed Content Tabs

The Content Hub interface includes multiple tabs for organizing content:

The first tab displays recently accessed or featured content templates, showing the most commonly used solutions for quick access to popular configurations.

The second tab organizes content by specific categories or vendor classifications, making it easy to find templates from particular technology providers.

The third tab shows additional content views, including specialized templates and advanced configurations for more complex deployment scenarios.

### Installed Content Management

The installed content section provides comprehensive management of deployed templates:

- **Deployed Templates**: Complete list of currently installed pipeline templates
- **Installation Dates**: When each template was deployed to your environment
- **Template Status**: Active status and health indicators for installed content
- **Management Options**: Update, modify, or remove installed templates

## Filtering the Content

You can filter the content using the left-hand side panel with several filter categories:

- **Device Types**:

  Use the **Device Type** drop-down list to select specific device types like **Windows**. When selected, the device type name replaces the drop-down label, and the content area filters to show only solutions for that device type.

  To remove a device type filter, click the X button on the right side of the selected device type, which will restore the **Device Type** drop-down list.

  :::note
  Clicking on the drop-down lists folds them to make room for the items below them.
  :::

- **Target Systems**:

  Use the **Target** drop-down list to filter by destination systems. For example, selecting **Elasticsearch** will filter the content to display only solutions that output to Elasticsearch targets.

  Each target option has a checkbox that can be ticked to apply the filter. Multiple targets can be selected simultaneously to broaden the filter scope.

- **Device Vendors**:

  The **Device vendor** drop-down list allows filtering by technology vendors. Selecting **Fortinet**, for instance, will show only solutions designed for Fortinet devices and services.

  Like target filters, vendor filters use checkboxes and support multiple selections for comprehensive filtering.

## Accessing the Content

In the main viewing area, content access panes display prominent features of each template. Each solution pane shows key integration capabilities, such as **Microsoft Sentinel** compatibility, along with vendor information and template categories.

To access detailed information about any template, simply click on its content pane. This will navigate you to the comprehensive **Details** view for that specific solution.

### Detailed Content View

The detailed view provides comprehensive information about the selected template, organized into two main sections:

- **Left Panel**: Contains a comprehensive description of what the pipeline does, what inputs it can handle, what outputs are to be expected, and implementation requirements. This section serves as your primary reference for understanding the template's functionality.

- **Right Panel**: Displays a summary of the pipeline's technical details including device type and target system, device vendor information, and a list of processors used in the pipeline with links to their respective documentation.

### Enhanced Content Presentation

The full page view provides complete details about the selected template including:

- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for deployment and configuration
- **Configuration Requirements**: Prerequisites and system requirements needed before installation
- **Integration Details**: How the template connects with existing infrastructure components
- **Documentation Links**: Access to related configuration guides and best practices

To see the complete list of processors used by the pipeline, click the **See all processors** drop-down list button, which will expand to show all processing components.

:::info Installing the Solution
To install the pipeline solution, click the **Install this pipeline template** button located in the top right corner. Once the solution is successfully installed, you will see a confirmation summary displaying the installation status and next steps.
:::

### Dependency Management

When installing content that requires additional components, the system will present a dependency modal dialog. This modal lists all required dependencies and allows you to review what will be installed alongside your selected template.

### Installation Restrictions

The system includes built-in protection against duplicate installations. When you attempt to install content that has already been deployed to your environment, you will encounter restrictions designed to maintain system integrity.

If you try to install a template that is already present, the system will display a notification indicating that the content is already installed and preventing the duplicate installation attempt.

This protection mechanism ensures:

- **Content Integrity**: Prevents conflicts from duplicate installations
- **System Stability**: Maintains consistent pipeline configurations
- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoids redundant content storage

## Additional Resources

At the bottom of the Content Hub interface, you'll find the **Can't find what you're looking for?** section, which provides additional options for users who need templates not currently available in the hub. This section includes a link to comprehensive pipeline documentation and a button to initiate creating a custom pipeline from scratch.
