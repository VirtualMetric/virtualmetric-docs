## Dependency Management

When installing content that requires additional components, the system will present a dependency modal dialog. This modal provides:

- **Dependency List** - Complete list of all required dependencies
- **Review Options** - Ability to review what will be installed alongside your selected template
- **Installation Confirmation** - Final confirmation before proceeding with the installation

### Understanding Dependencies

Dependencies may include:

- **Additional Pipeline Components** - Required processors or transformations
- **Data Source Integrations** - Necessary input connectors
- **Output Integrations** - Required target system connections
- **Configuration Files** - Template-specific configuration requirements

## Installation Restrictions

The system includes built-in protection against duplicate installations to maintain system integrity:

### Duplicate Prevention

When you attempt to install content that has already been deployed to your environment:

- **Restriction Notice** - The system will display a notification indicating that the content is already installed
- **Installation Prevention** - The duplicate installation attempt will be blocked
- **Alternative Actions** - Options to update or modify existing installations instead

This protection mechanism prevents conflicts from duplicate installations and maintains consistent pipeline configurations.

## Managing Installed Solutions

### Viewing Installed Content

Access your installed solutions through the **Installed Content Management** section:

- **Deployed Templates** - Complete list of currently installed pipeline templates
- **Installation Dates** - When each template was deployed to your environment
- **Template Status** - Active status and health indicators for installed content
- **Management Options** - Update, modify, or remove installed templates

### Solution Management Actions

For each installed solution, you can:

1. **Update** - Apply newer versions of the template when available
2. **Modify** - Customize configuration parameters for your specific needs
3. **Monitor** - View performance metrics and health status
4. **Remove** - Uninstall solutions that are no longer needed


The Content Hub installation process is designed to be straightforward while maintaining system security and stability through comprehensive dependency management and duplicate protection.
