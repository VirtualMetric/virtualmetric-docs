# Installing Solutions

This section covers the process of installing pipeline templates from the Content Hub, including template selection, installation procedures, and dependency management.

## Accessing Content

In the viewing area, the content access panes display prominent features of the content. Solutions may indicate specific integrations such as **Microsoft Sentinel** compatibility.

To access the content, click on its pane to navigate to the **Details** view.

### Detailed Content View

In the detailed view, there will be general information about the solution:

- **Left Panel**: Comprehensive description of what the pipeline does, what inputs it can handle, what outputs are to be expected, and implementation requirements
- **Right Panel**: Summary of the pipeline's technical details such as its device type and target, its device vendor, which processors are used with links to their documentation

### Enhanced Content Presentation

The full page view provides complete details about the selected template including:

- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for deployment
- **Configuration Requirements**: Prerequisites and system requirements
- **Integration Details**: How the template connects with existing infrastructure
- **Documentation Links**: Access to related configuration guides and best practices

To see the whole list of processors used by the pipeline, click the **See all processors** drop-down list button.

### Installation Steps

1. **Select Template** - Click on the template card to view detailed information
2. **Review Details** - Examine the template's description, requirements, and technical specifications  
3. **Check Prerequisites** - Verify that your system meets all requirements
4. **Install Template** - Click the **Install this pipeline template** button
5. **Confirm Installation** - Review the installation summary and confirmation

### Dependency Management

When installing content with dependencies, you may encounter a dependency management modal that will:

- **List Required Dependencies** - Show all components needed for the template to function
- **Automatic Resolution** - Attempt to install required dependencies automatically
- **Dependency Confirmation** - Request confirmation before installing additional components
- **Installation Order** - Install dependencies in the correct sequence

## Installation Restrictions

You may encounter restrictions when attempting to install content that has already been deployed.

The system prevents duplicate installations to maintain content integrity. When you attempt to install content that is already present, you'll see a notification indicating that the content is already installed.

This protection mechanism ensures:

- **Content Integrity** - Prevents conflicts from duplicate installations
- **System Stability** - Maintains consistent pipeline configurations
- **Resource Efficiency** - Avoids redundant content storage

### Managing Duplicate Installations

If you encounter a duplicate installation warning:

1. **Check Installed Content** - Review the installed content section to verify current installations
2. **Update Existing** - Consider updating the existing installation instead of reinstalling
3. **Remove and Reinstall** - If necessary, remove the existing template before installing a new version
4. **Contact Support** - For persistent issues, contact system administrator

## Post-Installation

After successful installation:

- **Verify Installation** - Check the installed content section to confirm the template is properly deployed
- **Test Configuration** - Validate that the pipeline is functioning correctly
- **Monitor Performance** - Review initial data processing and performance metrics
- **Documentation Review** - Access template-specific documentation for ongoing management
