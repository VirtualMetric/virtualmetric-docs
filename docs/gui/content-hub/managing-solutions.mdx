# Managing Solutions

The **Managing Solutions** interface provides comprehensive tools for overseeing your deployed Content Hub templates and solutions. This centralized management system allows you to monitor, maintain, and optimize your installed solutions to ensure they continue meeting your operational requirements.

## Installed Solutions Dashboard

The installed solutions dashboard serves as the central hub for managing all deployed Content Hub templates within your DataStream environment. This interface provides comprehensive visibility into your solution ecosystem.

### Solution Overview

The dashboard displays detailed information about each installed solution:

- **Solution Name**: Clear identification of deployed templates
- **Installation Date**: When each solution was deployed to your environment
- **Solution Status**: Active status and health indicators for installed content
- **Version Information**: Current version and available updates
- **Resource Usage**: System resources consumed by each solution
- **Performance Metrics**: Data throughput and processing statistics

### Status Monitoring

Each installed solution displays real-time status information:

- **Active**: Solution is operational and processing data correctly
- **Warning**: Minor issues that don't prevent operation but may need attention
- **Error**: Critical issues that require immediate attention
- **Updating**: Solution is being updated or reconfigured
- **Disabled**: Solution has been temporarily disabled
