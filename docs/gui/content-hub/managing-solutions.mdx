# Managing Solutions

This section covers the ongoing management of installed Content Hub templates, including organization, filtering, and maintenance of deployed solutions.

## Filtering the Content

You can filter the content based on multiple criteria to quickly find the templates you need:

### Device Type Filtering

On left-hand side panel, under the **Device Type** drop-down list, click **Windows**. The selected device type will be moved to the place of the drop-down list.

The content in the viewing area will be filtered to display only solutions based on the **Windows** device type.

Clicking on the X on the right side of the selected device type removes the filter and exposes the **Device Type** drop-down list again.

:::note
Clicking on the drop-down lists folds them to make room for the items below them.

### Target Filtering

On the left-hand side panel, under the **Target** drop-down list, tick the checkbox of **Elasticsearch**.

The content in the viewing area will be filtered to display only solutions with **Elasticsearch** as their target.

Unticking the checkbox removes the filter.

### Device Vendor Filtering

On the left-hand side panel, under the **Device vendor** drop-down list, tick the checkbox of **Fortinet**.

The content in the viewing area will be filtered to display only solutions with **Fortinet** as their device vendor.

Unticking the checkbox removes the filter.
