# Quick Routes

Quick routes provide a streamlined interface for setting up basic data routing configurations without complex conditional logic. This simplified approach allows you to rapidly deploy common routing scenarios between devices, pipelines, and targets.

## Dashboard Overview

The quick routes dashboard displays all configured routes in an organized table format. From here you can view existing routes, create new ones, and manage route configurations.

Apply filters to narrow down the route list based on status, device type, or target configuration for efficient route management.

## Creating New Routes

### Device Selection

When creating a new route, you start by selecting the source device configuration:

<Image id="quick-routes-add-device-select-type" width="100%" alt="Device type selection interface showing available device options"/>

Choose from available device types that will serve as the data source for your route.

<Image id="quick-routes-add-device-select-multiple" width="100%" alt="Multiple device selection interface for route configuration"/>

Select multiple devices if you need to route data from several sources simultaneously.

<Image id="quick-routes-add-device-create-new-selected" width="100%" alt="Create new device option selected in quick routes interface"/>

Alternatively, create a new device configuration directly from the routing interface if needed.

### Target Configuration

After configuring the source device, specify the destination target:

<Image id="quick-routes-add-target-select-type" width="100%" alt="Target type selection showing available output destinations"/>

Select the target type that will receive the routed data from your source devices.

<Image id="quick-routes-add-target-select-multiple" width="100%" alt="Multiple target selection for data distribution routing"/>

Configure multiple targets to distribute data to several destinations simultaneously.

<Image id="quick-routes-add-target-create-new-selected" width="100%" alt="Create new target option selected in route configuration"/>

Create new target configurations as needed for your routing requirements.

### Pipeline Configuration

<Image id="quick-routes-configure-route" width="100%" alt="Route configuration interface showing pipeline selection options"/>

Configure the processing pipeline that will handle data transformation between source and destination.

<Image id="quick-routes-configure-route-select-pipeline" width="100%" alt="Pipeline selection dropdown showing available processing pipelines"/>

Choose from existing pipelines or create new ones to process data according to your requirements.

<Image id="quick-routes-configure-route-pipeline-selected" width="100%" alt="Pipeline selected and configured for the route"/>

Confirm your pipeline selection and review the complete route configuration.

## Route Management

### Device and Target Details

<Image id="quick-routes-device-target-details-and-remove-options" width="100%" alt="Detailed view of device and target configurations with removal options"/>

View detailed information about configured devices and targets, including options to modify or remove components from the route.

### Route Removal

<Image id="quick-routes-remove-route-button" width="100%" alt="Remove route button highlighted in the interface"/>

Use the remove route option to delete routes that are no longer needed.

<Image id="quick-routes-remove-route-confirmation" width="100%" alt="Route removal confirmation dialog"/>

Confirm route deletion with the safety confirmation dialog to prevent accidental removal.

<Image id="quick-routes-route-deleted" width="100%" alt="Confirmation message showing route has been successfully deleted"/>

The system provides confirmation when routes are successfully removed from the configuration.

### Device Management

<Image id="quick-routes-device-remove-confirmation-modal" width="100%" alt="Device removal confirmation modal dialog"/>

When removing devices from routes, the system displays a confirmation modal to ensure intentional device removal and maintain routing integrity.

## Quick Routes Benefits

- **Simplified Configuration**: Streamlined interface for basic routing scenarios
- **Rapid Deployment**: Quick setup without complex conditional logic
- **Visual Management**: Clear dashboard view of all configured routes
- **Flexible Sources**: Support for multiple device types and configurations
- **Multiple Targets**: Route data to several destinations simultaneously
- **Safety Features**: Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental configuration changes

Quick routes are ideal for straightforward data routing scenarios where complex processing logic is not required, enabling efficient data flow management across your infrastructure.
