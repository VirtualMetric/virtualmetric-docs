## Interface Overview

The quick routes interface offers an efficient approach to basic routing configuration:

### Route Templates

The interface displays pre-configured routing templates for common scenarios:

- **Direct Routing**: Simple one-to-one data routing between source and destination
- **Multi-Target Routing**: Send data to multiple destinations simultaneously  
- **Conditional Routing**: Basic if-then routing based on simple data conditions
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute data across multiple targets for performance

### Configuration Panel

Each template provides essential configuration options:

### Basic Settings

- **Route Name**: Enter a descriptive identifier for the routing configuration
- **Source Selection**: Choose the input pipeline or data source
- **Target Selection**: Specify the destination pipeline, target, or multiple targets

### Simple Conditions

- **Field Matching**: Route data based on specific field values
- **Data Type Filtering**: Direct data based on content type or format
- **Time-based Routing**: Route data based on timestamps or scheduling

### Quick Actions

- **Apply Template**: Implement the selected routing template with current settings
- **Preview Route**: View the routing configuration before activation
- **Save as Template**: Store custom configurations for future reuse
- **Reset Configuration**: Clear all settings and start over

## Quick Setup Process

1. **Template Selection**: Choose a routing template that matches your data flow requirements
2. **Basic Configuration**: Set the route name, source, and target information
3. **Simple Rules**: Define any basic conditions or filters for the routing
4. **Validation**: Preview the configuration to ensure correct routing behavior
5. **Activation**: Apply the template to activate the routing configuration

The quick routes interface prioritizes ease of use and rapid deployment, making it ideal for standard routing scenarios that don't require complex conditional logic or advanced data transformation capabilities.
