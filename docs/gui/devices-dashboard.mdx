# Devices Dashboard

The Devices Dashboard is your central management interface for configuring and monitoring all data ingestion sources in your VirtualMetric DataStream environment. This interface provides comprehensive device management capabilities for both Push devices (which receive data) and Pull devices (Agents that collect data from local systems).

## Main Dashboard Overview

<Image id="devices-dashboard" width="100%" alt="Devices dashboard showing Push and Pull device categories with available device types"/>

The main dashboard displays devices organized into two distinct categories:

### Push Devices
Push devices are network-accessible endpoints that receive incoming log data from external sources. These devices listen on specified ports and protocols:

- **Syslog**: Standard protocol for collecting and forwarding log messages from various devices to a centralized server
- **HTTP**: Enables log data ingestion through HTTP protocol for efficient data transmission
- **UDP**: Allows log data collection using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for faster but less reliable transmission
- **TCP**: Collects logs using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for reliable and ordered data delivery
- **eStreamer**: A protocol designed for retrieving detailed event and log data from network and security devices

Each Push device shows enabled/disabled status counters, allowing you to quickly assess your device configuration state.

### Pull Devices (Agents)
Pull devices are lightweight agents installed on target systems to collect logs locally. These agents actively gather data from the systems they're installed on:

- **Windows**: The Windows agent collects logs from Windows systems including event logs, performance data, and security information
- **Linux**: Linux agent support (marked as "Coming Soon" in current interface)

Pull devices require agent installation and show connection status to help you monitor agent health and connectivity.

## Device Type Specific Views
