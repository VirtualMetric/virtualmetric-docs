# Create Account

To create a user account, you have to navigate to the [account creation page](https://app.dev.virtualmetric.com/) where you will find the form below.

- Make sure the credentials you enter&mdash;your e-mail address, your company name, etc.&mdash;are valid.
- Enter a strong password at least 8 characters long, containing a mixture of capital and small letters, numbers, and special characters. If the password is weak, it will be rejected and you will be asked to try a stronger one.

After filling in the required fields indicated, click the **Create Account** button to finish creating an account. You will be taken to the <Topic id="gui-welcome">**Welcome Dashboard**</Topic>.
