# Managing Quick Routes

This guide covers how to manage existing quick routes, including viewing route status, modifying configurations, and removing routes when needed.

## Routes Overview

The quick routes view displays all configured routes in an organized table format with columns for route name, source devices, target destinations, pipeline configurations, and status information. From here you can view existing routes, create new ones, and manage route configurations through a comprehensive management interface.

### Table Management

The view includes powerful search functionality to quickly locate specific routes by entering search terms that match route names, device identifiers, target names, or pipeline configurations. The search operates in real-time, filtering results as you type.

Additionally, you can apply filters to narrow down the route list based on various criteria including:
- Route status (active, inactive, error states)
- Device type (sensors, databases, APIs, etc.)
- Target configuration type (storage, analytics, alerts)
- Pipeline processing requirements

These filtering options enable efficient route management when working with large numbers of configured routes.

## Route Management

### Device and Target Details

The route management interface provides detailed views of configured devices and targets, including comprehensive information about each component's settings, status, and performance metrics. This detailed view includes options to modify component configurations or remove components from routes when needed.

For devices, you can view:
- Connection status and health metrics
- Data throughput statistics
- Configuration parameters
- Error logs and diagnostics

For targets, the details include:
- Delivery status and success rates
- Storage or processing capacity
- Configuration settings
- Performance metrics


### Modifying Route Configurations

You can modify existing routes by:

1. **Selecting the Route** - Click on any route in the table to access its details
2. **Edit Configuration** - Modify device, target, or pipeline settings as needed
3. **Validate Changes** - The system validates configuration changes before applying them
4. **Apply Updates** - Confirm changes to update the active route configuration

Changes to active routes are applied gracefully to avoid data loss or service interruption.

## Route Removal

### Removing Routes

When routes are no longer needed, you can remove them using the dedicated removal functionality. The system provides a clearly marked remove route option that initiates the deletion process.

Before any route is deleted, the system displays a safety confirmation dialog that requires explicit confirmation to proceed. This confirmation step prevents accidental route removal and includes details about the route being deleted, including affected devices, targets, and any dependent configurations.

After successful route removal, the system provides a confirmation message indicating that the route has been successfully deleted and is no longer active in the system.

### Device Management

When removing devices from existing routes, the system maintains routing integrity through careful validation. A confirmation modal appears when attempting to remove devices, ensuring that the removal is intentional and won't break other dependent routes or configurations.

The device removal confirmation includes:
- Impact analysis showing affected routes
- Warning messages for any potential data flow disruptions
- Options to reassign routes to alternative devices
- Confirmation requirements to proceed with removal

## Safety Features

### Confirmation Dialogs

All destructive actions require explicit confirmation to prevent accidental changes:

- **Route Deletion** - Confirms route removal with impact assessment
- **Device Removal** - Validates device removal with dependency checks
- **Configuration Changes** - Verifies modifications before applying
- **Pipeline Updates** - Ensures pipeline changes won't break data flow

### Validation Checks

The system performs comprehensive validation to maintain data integrity:

- **Configuration Validation** - Ensures all route components are properly configured
- **Dependency Checking** - Verifies that changes won't break dependent configurations
- **Resource Availability** - Confirms that required resources are available
- **Compatibility Testing** - Validates that devices, pipelines, and targets are compatible


The quick routes management interface provides comprehensive tools for managing your configured routes through the GUI.
