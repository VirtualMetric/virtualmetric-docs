# Creating Quick Routes

This is where you create simple data flow connections between devices, pipelines, and targets using a visual interface.

## Setup Process

To create a quick route, go to **Home** → **Routes** → **Quick Routes**.

The interface shows a canvas with three sections: Devices on the left, Pipeline in the center, and Targets on the right.

### Select Devices

On the left sidebar under **Devices**:

- If no devices exist, you'll see "There are no devices defined for routes"
- Click **Select device** to choose from configured devices
- You can select multiple devices for the same route

### Select Targets

In the sidebar under **Targets**:

- If no targets exist, you'll see "There are no targets defined for routes"
- Click **Select target** to choose from configured targets
- You can select multiple targets for the same route

### Configure Route

Once devices and targets are selected, connections appear on the canvas.

- A **Configure route** panel appears at the bottom showing the data flow path
- The panel shows device name → target name (e.g., "Configure route from Syslog eren-syslog-udp to target Console, marksconsole")
- Click **Insert pipeline within route** to add processing (optional)
- Click **Save route** to create the connection
- Click **Discard route** to cancel

## Filter Options

Use the **Filter devices and targets** dropdown at the top to organize your view and find specific components more easily.
