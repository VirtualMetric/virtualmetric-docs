# Creating Quick Routes

Quick routes provide an interface for connecting devices to targets through pipelines. The interface organizes devices on the left, targets on the right, and pipelines in the center with connections showing data flow.

## Device Selection

Click **Select device** to open the device selection modal showing:

### Device Types Available
- **Syslog**: Creates a Syslog server that accepts log messages over UDP or TCP connections
- **HTTP**: Creates an HTTP server that accepts messages via HTTP POST requests  
- **TCP**: Creates a server that accepts network messages over TCP connections
- **UDP**: Creates a server that accepts network messages over UDP connections
- **Windows**: Creates a monitoring agent that collects performance metrics and system logs from Windows systems
- **eStreamer**: Creates an eStreamer client that connects to an eStreamer server to receive events

Each device type shows:
- **Name and description**
- **Enabled/Disabled count**
- **Choose device type** button to proceed

### Multiple Device Selection
- Select multiple devices by clicking the **Select device** links
- Each selected device appears as a card on the left side
- **"i" information button** shows device details
- **"not selected"** status indicates unselected pipelines

## Target Selection

Click **Select target** to open the target selection modal showing:

### Target Types Available
- **Azure Sentinel**: Creates a target that writes log messages into Microsoft Sentinel workspace tables
- **Console**: Creates a target that writes log messages to the standard output
- **File**: Creates a file target that writes log messages to files in various formats like JSON, CSV, etc.
- **Azure Data Explorer**: Creates an Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) target that ingests data directly into ADX tables
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Creates a target that writes log messages to Azure Blob Storage with support for various formats

Each target type shows:
- **Name and description**
- **Enabled/Disabled count**
- **Choose target type** button to proceed

### Multiple Target Selection
- Select multiple targets by clicking the **Select target** links
- Each selected target appears as a card on the right side
- **"not selected"** status indicates unselected pipelines

## Route Configuration

When devices and targets are connected, a **Configure route** panel appears showing:

- **Route description**: "Configure route from [device] to target [target]"
- **Insert pipeline within route** link with "+" icon
- **Optional** label indicating pipeline selection is not required

### Pipeline Selection
- Click the **Insert pipeline within route** link to add processing
- Pipelines appear as blue rectangular nodes in the center
- Multiple pipeline steps can be chained together
- **Save route** button confirms the configuration
- **Discard route** button cancels changes

## Route Management

### Viewing Routes
- **Filter devices and targets** dropdown to organize the display
- **Search** functionality to find specific routes
- **Status filters** to show active/inactive routes

### Route Actions
- **Remove route** button (trash icon) for deleting connections
- **Confirmation modal** appears before deletion: "Are you sure you want to remove this route?"
- **Device and target details** panels show configuration options
- **Route deleted** confirmation message after successful removal

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Open Quick Routes** - Navigate to Routes â†’ Quick Routes
2. **Select devices** - Click "Select device" and choose from available device types
3. **Select targets** - Click "Select target" and choose destination types  
4. **Connect routes** - Drag connections between devices and targets
5. **Configure pipeline** (optional) - Add processing steps using "Insert pipeline within route"
6. **Save route** - Click "Save route" to activate the data flow
