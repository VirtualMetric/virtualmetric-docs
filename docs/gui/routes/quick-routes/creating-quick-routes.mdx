# Creating Quick Routes

Quick routes provide a streamlined interface for setting up basic data routing configurations without complex conditional logic. This simplified approach allows you to rapidly deploy common routing scenarios between devices, pipelines, and targets.

## Overview

Quick routes are ideal for straightforward data routing scenarios where complex processing logic is not required, enabling efficient data flow management across your infrastructure. The simplified interface reduces configuration complexity while maintaining the flexibility needed for most common routing use cases.

## Creating New Routes

### Device Selection

When creating a new route, you begin by selecting the source device configuration that will provide data for your route. The device selection interface presents all available device types in a categorized list, making it easy to find the appropriate data source.

Available device types typically include:
- Database connections
- API endpoints
- File system monitors
- Network sensors
- Message queues
- Custom integrations

You can select multiple devices if you need to route data from several sources simultaneously. This multi-device selection enables data aggregation scenarios where information from different sources needs to be combined and routed together.

If your required device configuration doesn't exist, you can create a new device configuration directly from the routing interface. This streamlined workflow eliminates the need to navigate to separate device management screens during route setup.

### Target Configuration

After configuring the source device, you specify the destination target where the routed data will be sent. The target selection interface displays available output destinations organized by type and capability.

Common target types include:
- Data warehouses
- Analytics platforms
- Alert systems
- File storage locations
- External APIs
- Monitoring views

The interface supports configuring multiple targets to distribute data to several destinations simultaneously. This multi-target routing enables scenarios where the same data needs to be sent to different systems for various purposes such as storage, analysis, and alerting.

Similar to device configuration, you can create new target configurations directly within the routing interface if your desired destination isn't already configured in the system.

### Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline configuration step allows you to specify the processing pipeline that will handle data transformation between source and destination. The pipeline selection interface provides a dropdown menu showing all available processing pipelines with descriptions of their capabilities.

Pipeline options typically include:
- Data transformation rules
- Filtering and validation logic
- Format conversion (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.)
- Enrichment and aggregation functions
- Custom processing scripts

You can choose from existing pipelines that match your data processing requirements, or create new pipelines if specialized processing is needed. Each pipeline displays its input/output formats and processing capabilities to help you make the appropriate selection.

Once you've selected a pipeline, you can review the complete route configuration including source devices, target destinations, and processing pipeline before finalizing the route creation.

## Step-by-Step Creation Process

1. **Access Quick Routes** - Navigate to the Routes section and select Quick Routes
2. **Start New Route** - Click the "Create New Route" button
3. **Select Source Device** - Choose the device that will provide data for your route
4. **Configure Target** - Specify where the routed data will be sent
5. **Choose Pipeline** - Select the processing pipeline for data transformation
6. **Review Configuration** - Verify all settings before finalizing
7. **Create Route** - Confirm the route creation and activate the data flow

The quick routes creation process is designed to be intuitive and efficient, allowing you to establish data routing in minutes rather than hours.
