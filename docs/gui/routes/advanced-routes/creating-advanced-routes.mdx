# Creating Advanced Routes

This is where you create complex routing configurations with conditional logic and advanced processing options.

## Prerequisites

Before creating advanced routes, you need at least one pipeline. If no pipelines exist, you'll see:

- **No pipelines found** message
- **Create Pipeline** button to create your first pipeline

## Creation Process

To create an advanced route, go to **Home** → **Routes** → **Advanced Routes**.

Click **Add new route** in the top right.

### Route Details

Configure the basic route settings:

- **Route name** - Unique identifier for the route  
- **Route description** - Optional text (0/100 character limit)
- **Filter** - Optional filtering criteria
- **Default target** - Set default target (e.g., /dev/null)
- **Select pipeline** - Choose from available pipelines
- **Route Status** - Enable/disable toggle (enabled by default)

### Route Configuration

Configure advanced routing logic and conditions on the second tab.

## Route Complexity

Advanced routes support:

- **Conditional routing** based on data content
- **Multiple data sources** and destinations
- **Complex filtering logic** with multiple criteria
- **Error handling and retry logic**
