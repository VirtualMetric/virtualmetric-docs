# Managing Advanced Routes

This guide covers the comprehensive management of advanced routes, including viewing, editing, cloning, and safely removing complex routing configurations.

## Overview

The advanced routes view provides detailed visibility into all routing configurations with comprehensive management capabilities. The interface displays routes in a structured table format with advanced filtering and search functionality.

## Table View and Management

The main view presents all configured routes in a comprehensive table view that displays essential information for each route including source devices, target destinations, processing pipelines, and routing conditions. Each row in the table represents a complete routing configuration with status indicators and quick access controls.

### Search and Filtering Capabilities

The view includes powerful search functionality that allows you to quickly locate specific routes by entering search terms related to route names, device types, target configurations, or routing conditions. The search feature supports partial matching and real-time filtering as you type.

Advanced filtering options enable you to narrow down the route list based on multiple criteria simultaneously:
- Route status (active, inactive, pending)
- Device type (sensors, controllers, gateways)
- Target type (databases, APIs, file systems)
- Routing complexity level
- Creation date and last modified date

### Route Management Actions

Each route in the table view provides direct access to management actions through action buttons or context menus:
- **Edit**: Modify existing route configurations
- **Clone**: Duplicate routes to create similar configurations quickly
- **Delete**: Remove routes with safety confirmations
- **Export**: Download route configurations for backup or migration
- **Test**: Validate routing logic and connectivity
- **Monitor**: View real-time routing performance and statistics

## Route Editing and Management

### Route Editing Workflow

#### Step 1: Route Modification Interface

The editing interface provides comprehensive access to all routing parameters and conditions. When you select a route for editing, the system loads the current configuration into an editable form that mirrors the creation interface but pre-populated with existing values.

#### Step 2: Advanced Configuration Access

The second step of the editing process opens detailed configuration options where you can modify advanced conditional logic and routing rule parameters. This step provides granular control over:

- Complex condition statements
- Multi-path routing scenarios
- Data transformation pipelines
- Target prioritization rules
- Performance optimization settings

#### Change Tracking and Visibility

The editing interface includes change tracking functionality that highlights modifications made to routing configurations. This feature provides clear visual indicators showing:
- Fields that have been modified from their original values
- New additions to the configuration
- Removed or disabled routing elements
- Validation status for changed configurations

Before applying updates, you can review all changes to ensure they align with your intended modifications.

### Configuration Management

#### Saving Changes

When editing routes, changes are validated in real-time to ensure configuration integrity:

1. **Field Validation**: Individual fields are validated as you make changes
2. **Logic Validation**: Conditional logic is checked for consistency
3. **Connectivity Testing**: Target connectivity is verified when possible
4. **Resource Check**: System resources are validated for the configuration

#### Rollback Options

If issues arise after applying changes, you have several rollback options:

- **Undo Last Change**: Reverse the most recent modification
- **Restore Previous Version**: Return to a previously saved configuration
- **Reset to Defaults**: Return route to its original creation state

## Route Cloning

The route cloning feature enables rapid creation of similar configurations by duplicating existing routes. This functionality is particularly valuable for:

- Creating variations of complex routing scenarios
- Establishing similar routes for different device groups
- Building test configurations based on production routes
- Reducing setup time for routes with shared characteristics

When cloning a route, the system creates an exact copy of the configuration that you can then modify to meet specific requirements while preserving the complex logic of the original route.

### Cloning Process

1. **Select Source Route**: Choose the route to be cloned from the table view
2. **Initiate Clone**: Click the clone action to start the duplication process
3. **Modify Settings**: Update the cloned route with new parameters
4. **Validate Configuration**: Ensure the cloned route works correctly
5. **Deploy Clone**: Activate the new route once configuration is complete

## Route Deletion and Safety

### Deletion Safety Mechanisms

The system implements comprehensive safety measures to prevent accidental deletion of complex routing configurations that may be critical to your data flow operations.

#### Multi-Step Confirmation Process

Route deletion requires multiple confirmation steps to ensure intentional removal:

1. **Initial Deletion Request**: Triggered when you select the delete action
2. **Impact Assessment**: System displays routes and processes that may be affected
3. **Confirmation Dialog**: Presents detailed warnings about the deletion consequences
4. **Final Confirmation**: Requires explicit confirmation to complete the deletion

#### Safety Warnings and Impact Analysis

Before allowing route deletion, the system provides detailed information about potential impacts:
- Active data flows that use the route
- Dependent configurations that reference the route
- Historical data processing statistics
- Alternative routing options if available

This comprehensive approach ensures that you understand the full implications of route removal before proceeding with the deletion.



Advanced routes provide powerful capabilities for complex data routing while maintaining comprehensive management tools through the interface.
