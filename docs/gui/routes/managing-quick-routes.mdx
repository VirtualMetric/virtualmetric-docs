## Creating

:::note

The following flow assumes this is your first route.

From the left sidebar:

- Under the **Devices** label, click the **Select device** button.

  This opens a window with two tabs:

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="select-device" label="Select Device" default>
      Select an existing device, then

      - Tick the checkboxes of the devices you want to select
      - Click the blue **Select Device(s)** button

      - Click the blue **Choose device type** button to begin.

        -or-

      - Click the **Back to device types** to cancel

      After you select a device, it will be moved to the canvas on the right, along with the device selection button.

      In the canvas area, you can select the device by clicking on it. Clicking the vertical ellipsis &#x22EE; on its right opens a dropdown with the _Go to device details_ and _Remove device_ options.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

- Under the **Targets** label, click the **Select target** button.

  This opens a window with two tabs:

  <Tabs>

      Select an existing target, then

      - Tick the checkboxes of the targets you want to select
    
      - Click the blue **Select Target(s)** button
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="choose-target-type" label="Choose Target Type">

      - Click the blue **Select Target(s)** button
    
        -or-

      - Click the **Back to target types** to cancel.

      After you select a target, it will be moved to the canvas on the right, along with the target selection button.

      In the canvas area, you can select the target by clicking on it. Clicking the vertical ellipsis &#x22EE; on its right opens a dropdown with the _Go to target details_ and _Remove target_ options.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

### Configuring

Once devices and targets are selected and moved to the canvas, you can connect them.

At this point, your cursor will change to a crosshair. To create your route,

- Click the connector handle on the right side of the device and drag to the connector handle on the left side of the target.
  A modal will appear with the following options:

  - Click **Discard route** if you do not want to create the route
  - Click the *Insert pipeline within the route* button to add a pipeline to the route.

    This will open another modal window where:

    - You can search for existing pipelines using the **Search pipelines** box.
    - Select a pipeline by ticking the selection button to the left of its name.

    - To complete adding a pipeline, click **Select pipeline**,

      -or-

      To discard the selection, click **Cancel**.

The modal box closes, and a dotted line appears, connecting the device to the target.

You will also notice that

- A blue square with a `+` appears it in the middle of the dotted line. Click this square to **add more pipelines**.

- A window with a **Selected pipeline** list appears at the bottom, displaying the name of the pipeline(s) you selected. Click **Change** or **Remove** to modify the selection.

To undo your changes, click the red **Discard route** button at the bottom.

To keep the route, click the blue **Save route** button.

The window will close, and the saved route will be displayed in the middle of the dotted line as a blue rectangle, with the selected pipeline's name on it.

Clicking this rectangle will toggle the route editing window so that you can edit its configuration later.
