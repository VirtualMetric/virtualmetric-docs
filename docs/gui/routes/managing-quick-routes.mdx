## Creating

:::note
If no routes exist, there will be a sidebar on the left containing the buttons for adding devices and targets.

The following creation process is described based on the assumption that it is the first route being created.

From the left sidebar:

- Under the **Devices** label, click the **Select device** button.

  This opens a windows with two tabs:

  - **Select Device** - Select an already-created device.
  - **Choose Device Type** - Choose a device type to create a new device. To start creating a device, click the blue **Choose device type** button.
    - Tick the checkboxes of the devices you want to select
    - Click the blue **Select Device(s)** button

      -or-

      Click the **Back to device types** to cancel

      After you select a device, it will be moved to the canvas on the right, along with the device selection button.

      In the canvas area, you can select the device by clicking on it. Clicking the vertical ellipsis &#x22EE; on its right opens a dropdown with the _Go to device details_ and _Remove device_ options.

- Under the **Targets** label, click the **Select target** button.

  This opens a windows with two tabs:

  - **Select Target** - Select an already-created device.
  - **Choose Target Type** - Choose a target type to create a new target. To start creating a target, click the blue **Choose target type** button.
    - Tick the checkboxes of the targets you want to select
    - Click the blue **Select Target(s)** button

      -or-

      Click the **Back to target types** to cancel

      After you select a target, it will be moved to the canvas on the right, along with target selection button.

      In the canvas area, you can select the target by clicking on it. Clicking the vertical ellipsis &#x22EE; on its right opens a dropdown with the _Go to target details_ and _Remove target_ options.

### Configuring

Once devices and targets are selected and moved to the canvas, you can connect them.

At this point, your cursor will change to a crosshair. To create your route,

- Click the arrow sign on the right side of the device and drag your cursor until it reaches the arrow sign on the left side of the target.
  A modal will appear with the following options:

  - Click **Discard route** if you do not want to create the route
  - Click the *Insert pipeline within the route* button to add a pipeline to the route.

    This will open another modal window where:

    - You can search for existing pipelines using the **Search pipelines** box.
    - Select a pipeline by ticking the selection button to the left of its name.

    - To complete adding a pipeline, click **Select pipeline**,

      -or-

      To discard the selection, click **Cancel**.

The modal box closes, and a dotted line appears, connecting the device to the target.

You will also notice that

- A blue square with a `+` on appears it in the middle of the dotted line. You can click this square to **add more pipelines**.

- A window with a **Selected pipeline** list will appear at the bottom, displaying the name of the pipeline you have selected. Click **Change** or **Remove** performs these actions on the selected pipeline.

To undo your changes, click the red **Discard route** button at the bottom.

To keep the route, click the blue **Save route** button.

The window will close, and the saved route will be displayed in the middle of the dotted line as a blue rectangle, with the selected pipeline's name on it.

Clicking this rectangle will toggle the route editing window so that you can edit its configuration later.
