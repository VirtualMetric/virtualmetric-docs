# Manage Roles

The **Manage Roles** interface provides administrators with comprehensive control over user roles and permissions within the **DataStream** platform. This system enables granular permission management, role assignment tracking, and detailed access control for organizational security and operational efficiency.

## Role Overview Dashboard

The main roles dashboard displays all available roles in your organization with their key characteristics:

The dashboard contains the following essential components:

- **Role table**: Displays Role name, Description, Permissions count, and Assigned Users count
- **Items per page**: Controls pagination settings for role display
- **Page navigation**: Shows current page and total pages
- **Action menu**: Three-dot menu for additional role management options

### Built-in Role Types

The system provides three fundamental role types with distinct permission levels:

#### User Role
- **Description**: Users have read-only access to all files, with no access to edit/delete actions
- **Permissions**: 176 read-only permissions
- **Use Case**: Recommended for standard users who need to view data and dashboards without modification capabilities

#### Owner Role  
- **Description**: Owner has the ability to read, edit and delete all files and make configurations
- **Permissions**: 340 comprehensive permissions
- **Assigned Users**: 1 user
- **Use Case**: Highest privilege level for system owners and primary administrators

#### Admin Role
- **Description**: Admin has the same abilities with owners to read, edit and delete all files and make configurations, cannot change owner information
- **Permissions**: 340 comprehensive permissions  
- **Assigned Users**: 2 users
- **Use Case**: Full administrative access with restrictions on owner account modifications

## Role Assignment Tracking

View detailed information about users assigned to specific roles:

- **jaynesmith@virtualmetric.com** - Jayne Smith

This view provides:
- **Real-time assignment counts**: Shows exact number of users per role
- **User identification**: Displays both email addresses and full names
- **Assignment tracking**: Monitors role distribution across the organization

## Detailed Permissions Management

The permissions interface shows specific access controls including:

### Fleet Management Permissions

### Permission Structure

Each permission follows a hierarchical naming convention:

- **ROUTE**: Specific route or page access
- **FUNCTIONAL_AREA**: System component (e.g., FLEET_MANAGEMENT)
- **SPECIFIC_ACTION**: Detailed permission scope (e.g., PULL_DEVICES, TARGETS)
- **SUB_COMPONENT**: Granular access control (e.g., OPENBSD, NETBSD, AZURE_BLOB_STORAGE)

## Role Management Best Practices

### Security Considerations

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign users the minimum permissions required for their responsibilities
- **Regular Auditing**: Periodically review role assignments and remove unnecessary access
- **Separation of Duties**: Distribute administrative responsibilities across multiple admin users

### Operational Guidelines

- **Owner Role**: Limit to one or two trusted individuals for critical system management
- **Admin Role**: Assign to technical team members requiring configuration access
- **User Role**: Default assignment for standard operational users

### Permission Monitoring

- **Assignment Tracking**: Monitor user counts per role for security oversight
- **Access Reviews**: Regular review of permission lists for compliance requirements
- **Change Management**: Document role modifications for audit trails

The role management system ensures robust security through granular permission control while maintaining operational flexibility for diverse organizational needs.
