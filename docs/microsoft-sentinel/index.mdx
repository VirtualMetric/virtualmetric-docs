## Prerequisites

- An _Azure_ subscription with permissions to create resources
- A Log Analytics workspace (required by **Microsoft Sentinel**)
- _Administrative_ access to run PowerShell or Bash commands

Open a **PowerShell** or **Terminal** with _Admin_ rights, and navigate to `<vm_root>`. Then, type the following command and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
  ```PowerShell
  C:\<vm_root>\vmetric-director -sentinel
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
  ```bash
  ~/path/to/<vm_root>: ./vmetric-director -sentinel
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Authentication Methods

You will be presented two authentication options:

```PowerShell {1,5,6}
Welcome to the Microsoft Sentinel Integration!

Choose Authentication Method:

> Browser Authentication
  Device Code Authentication

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'q' to quit.
```

* **Browser Authentication**
   
   Recommended for desktop GUI environments since it is user-friendly and secure.

   With this option, a browser window will automatically open. Sign in with your **Azure** credentials, and grant the necessary permissions when prompted.

* **Device Code Authentication**
 
   Ideal for systems without a desktop environment&mdash;e.g. server installations, CLI-only environments, etc It is also useful when browser access is restricted on the local machine.

   With this option, a code will be displayed in your terminal. Visit `microsoft.com/devicelogin` in any browser and enter the provided code. Sign in with your **Azure** credentials, and grant the necessary permissions when prompted.

Select your preferred authentication method using the arrow keys and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>. The system will then guide you through the process.

### Post-Authentication

After a successful authentication, you'll see this confirmation screen:

```PowerShell {1}
Authentication Successful!

You have successfully authenticated!

Press any key to proceed.
```

You have successfully authenticated! You can continue with the setup by pressing any key.

## Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinel Setup

After the authentication step is completed, you will need to set up the _Log Analytics_ workspace, which is required for **Microsoft Sentinel**. Here, we will focus on creating a new workspace as it's the most comprehensive one, but here's what you need to know about either option:

### Creating a New Workspace

This is best for fresh installations. It gives you full control over workspace configuration, ensures all required features are properly enabled, and automatically sets up necessary permissions.

### Using an Existing Workspace

Skip the workspace creation steps and verify that 

  - **Microsoft Sentinel** is enabled
  - you have the necessary permissions
  - the workspace is in a supported region

:::note
If you choose to use an existing workspace, you can follow the same steps, but you should select "`Use an existing Log Analytics Workspace`" when prompted. The subsequent configuration steps will be adjusted accordingly.
:::

Select the first option and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short> to start creating a new _Log Analytics_ Worspace.

```PowerShell {1,5,6}
Integration Method

How do you want to set up the integration?

> Create a new Log Analytics Workspace
  Use an existing Log Analytics Workspace

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

Provide your _Azure Subscription_ name and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5}
Select Subscription

Choose the subscription you want to use:

> <your_subscription>

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

Select the region you desire and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5-14}
Select Region

Choose the region you want to use:

> North Europe
  South Central US
  South India
  Southeast Asia
  UK South
  UK West
  West Europe
  West India
  West US
  West US 2

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

You will now create a resource group. Select the first option and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5,6}
Resource Group Option

Choose how to manage the resource group:

> Create a new Resource Group
  Use an existing Resource Group

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

Provide your `<resource_group_name>` and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5}
Resource Group Name

Enter the resource group name (default: vmetric):

<your_resource_group_name>

Press enter to confirm.
```

You will now create the _Log Analytics_ Workspace. Provide your `<instance_name>` and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5}
Instance Name

Enter the instance name (default: vmetric-loganalytics):

<your_instance_name>

Press enter to confirm.
```

**Director** will now create the _Log Analytics_ workspace, enable **Microsoft Sentinel**, and configure the _Data Collection Endpoint_ and the necessary _Data Collection Rules_.

This step may take some time, as you will prompted on the screen.

```PowerShell {1,5}
Creating Workspace

Please wait while we create your workspace...

This may take a few minutes.

Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

## Integration Methods

After the workspace is set up, you will need to choose an integration method:

```PowerShell {1,5,7}
Setup Complete

Log Analytics Workspace 'your_instance_name' is ready for use.

Press 'r' to set up an App Registration.

Press 'm' to continue with Managed Identity. (Please refer to the documentation)

Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

### App Registration

When you press <kb-short>R</kb-short>, you will proceed to _App Registration_. This will involve authentication via the browser which will launch automatically.

Choose this option when you

- are running **Director** on non-Azure environments (on-premises servers, other cloud providers)
- need to share access across multiple systems
- need a more fine-grained control over permissions and want to manage credentials manually, e.g. when you require _credential rotation_ policies

This method has more flexible deployment options as the credentials are portable. The method can be used anywhere with internet access, and it is easier to manage in multi-tenant scenarios.

```PowerShell {1}
Integration Complete

VirtualMetric Target Configuration.

targets:
  - name: sentinel
    type: sentinel
    properties:
      tenant_id: "<your-tenant-id>"
      client_id: "<your-client-id>"
      client_secret: "<your-client-secret>"
      endpoint: "https://<your-endpoint>"
      streams:
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"

Press 's' to save the configuration to the current path, press 'q' to quit.
```

### Managed Identity

Press <kb-short>M</kb-short> to proceed with _Managed Identity_ authentication:

Choose this option when you

- are running **Director** on **Azure** VMs
- are using **Azure Arc**-enabled servers
- want to avoid managing credentials manually, and need enhanced security with automatic credential management

This method does not require any credential management; credentials are automatically rotated. It has tighter integration with **Azure** security due to which security is enhanced as no secrets are stored in configuration files. It is also simpler to set up and maintain.

After the integration process is completed, you will see the following screen:

```PowerShell {1}
Integration Complete

VirtualMetric Target Configuration.

targets:
  - name: sentinel
    type: sentinel
    properties:
      endpoint: "https://<your-endpoint>"
      streams:
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"

Press 's' to save the configuration to the current path, press 'q' to quit.
```

:::warning
The automation program does not automatically configure permissions for _Managed Identity_. You will need to manually assign the required permissions in **Azure Portal**.
:::

To assign the necessary permissions, follow these steps for each _Data Collection Rule_ (DCR) that starts with "`vmetric`":

- Navigate to the DCR in the Azure Portal
- Select **Access Control (IAM)**
- Click **Add** > **Add role assignment**
- Assign the `Monitoring Metrics Publisher` role to your Managed Identity

For **Azure VMs**, the _Managed Identity_ is automatically created with the VM. Use the VM's system-assigned identity name in role assignments.

For **Azure Arc**-enabled servers, ensure **Azure Arc** is properly configured on your server. Then, use the **Arc**-enabled server's system-assigned identity name in role assignments.

:::note
If you encounter permission-related errors when running **Director**, verify that all required roles are properly assigned to your _Managed Identity_.
:::

## Configuration

From the configuration screen, copy the sentinel information by pressing <kb-short>S</kb-short> and paste it into a text editor like **Notepad**.

Create the following directory structure if it doesn't exist:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
  ```PowerShell
  C:\path\to\<vm_root>\director\config\targets
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
  ```bash
  ~/path/to/<vm_root>: ./director/config/targets
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then:

- either create a new file named `sentinel.yml`, and paste the _properties_ block you have copied from the screen, or
- move your saved `sentinel.yml` file containing the copied _properties_ block to this directory.

## Validation

Once the editing of properties is completed, validate the automation by doing the following:

1. Open your browser and navigate to the **Azure Portal: Data Collection Rules (DCR)**
2. Look for DCRs with the "`vmetric`" prefix
3. In each DCR's details page, check the **Data Sources** section to verify that the tables were created correctly
