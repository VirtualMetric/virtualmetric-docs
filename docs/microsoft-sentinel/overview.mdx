# Microsoft Sentinel: Overview

This section guides you through integrating **VirtualMetric Director** with Microsoft Sentinel using the command line.

## Prerequisites

To install **Director**, you need

- an **Azure** subscription with permissions to create resources
- a **Log Analytics** workspace (required by **Microsoft Sentinel**)
- a PowerShell or Bash terminal with _Administrative_ access

Open the terminal and navigate to `<vm_root>`. Then, type the following command and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

<Tabs groupId="cli-options">
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
  ```PowerShell
  C:\<vm_root>\vmetric-director -sentinel
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
  ```bash
  ~/path/to/<vm_root>: ./vmetric-director -sentinel
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Authentication Methods

You will be presented with two authentication options:

```PowerShell {1,5,6}
Welcome to the Microsoft Sentinel Integration!

Choose Authentication Method:

> Browser Authentication
  Device Code Authentication

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'q' to quit.
```

* **Browser Authentication**
   
   Recommended for desktop GUI environments since it is user-friendly and secure.

   With this option, a browser window will automatically open. Sign in with your **Azure** credentials, and grant the necessary permissions when prompted.

* **Device Code Authentication**
 
   Ideal for systems without a desktop environment&mdash;e.g. server installations, CLI-only environments, etc. It is also useful when browser access is restricted on the local machine.

   With this option, a code will be displayed in your terminal. Visit `microsoft.com/devicelogin` in any browser and enter the provided code. Sign in with your **Azure** credentials, and grant the necessary permissions when prompted.

After selecting your preferred method using the arrow keys and pressing <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>, the system will then guide you through the process.

### Post-Authentication

After a successful authentication, you'll see this confirmation screen:

```PowerShell {1}
Authentication Successful!

You have successfully authenticated!

Press any key to proceed.
```

You have successfully authenticated! You can continue with the setup by pressing any key.

## Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinel Setup

After the authentication step is completed, you will need to set up the _Log Analytics_ workspace, which is required for **Microsoft Sentinel**. Here, we will focus on creating a new workspace as it's the most comprehensive one, but here's what you need to know about either option:

### Creating a New Workspace

Recommended for fresh installations. It gives you full control over workspace configuration, ensures all required features are properly enabled, and automatically sets up necessary permissions.

Select the option and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short> to start creating a new _Log Analytics_ Workspace.

```PowerShell {1,5,6}
Integration Method

How do you want to set up the integration?

> Create a new Log Analytics Workspace
  Use an existing Log Analytics Workspace

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

Provide your _Azure Subscription_ name and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5}
Select Subscription

Choose the subscription you want to use:

> <your_subscription>

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

Select the region you desire and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5-14}
Select Region

Choose the region you want to use:

> North Europe
  South Central US
  South India
  Southeast Asia
  UK South
  UK West
  West Europe
  West India
  West US
  West US 2

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

You will now create a resource group. Select the first option and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5,6}
Resource Group Option

Choose how to manage the resource group:

> Create a new Resource Group
  Use an existing Resource Group

Use up/down arrows to navigate and press enter to select.
Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

Provide your `<resource_group_name>` and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5}
Resource Group Name

Enter the resource group name (default: vmetric):

<your_resource_group_name>

Press enter to confirm.
```

You will now create the _Log Analytics_ Workspace. Provide your `<instance_name>` and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

```PowerShell {1,5}
Instance Name

Enter the instance name (default: vmetric-loganalytics):

<your_instance_name>

Press enter to confirm.
```

**Director** will now create the _Log Analytics_ workspace, enable **Microsoft Sentinel**, and configure the _Data Collection Endpoint_ and the necessary _Data Collection Rules_.

This step may take some time, as you will be prompted on the screen.

```PowerShell {1,5}
Creating Workspace

Please wait while we create your workspace...

This may take a few minutes.

Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

### Using an Existing Workspace

Select this option if you have already installed **Director** and authenticated it. Skip the workspace creation steps, and verify that 

  - **Microsoft Sentinel** is enabled
  - the workspace is in a supported region
  - you have the required access permissions

## Integration Methods

After the workspace is set up, you will need to choose an integration method:

```PowerShell {1,5,7}
Setup Complete

Log Analytics Workspace 'your_instance_name' is ready for use.

Press 'r' to set up an App Registration.

Press 'm' to continue with Managed Identity. (Please refer to the documentation)

Press 'b' to return, press 'q' to quit.
```

### App Registration

When you press <kb-short>R</kb-short>, you will proceed to _App Registration_. This will involve authentication via the browser which will launch automatically.

Choose this method when 

* you are running **Director** on non-Azure environments&mdash;e.g. on-premises servers, other cloud providers, etc.
* you need a more fine-grained control over permissions to manage credentials manually&mdash;e.g. when you require _credential rotation_ policies
* you want to share access across multiple systems

This method has more flexible deployment options as the credentials are portable, and it can be used anywhere with internet access, and it is easier to manage in multi-tenant scenarios.

```PowerShell {1}
Integration Complete

VirtualMetric Target Configuration.

targets:
  - name: sentinel
    type: sentinel
    properties:
      tenant_id: "<your-tenant-id>"
      client_id: "<your-client-id>"
      client_secret: "<your-client-secret>"
      endpoint: "https://<your-endpoint>"
      streams:
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"

Press 's' to save the configuration to the current path, press 'q' to quit.
```

### Managed Identity

To proceed with _Managed Identity_ authentication, press <kb-short>M</kb-short> on your keyboard.

Choose this method when you are running **Director** on **Azure** VMs, you have **Azure Arc**-enabled servers, or you want to avoid managing credentials manually and need enhanced security with automatic credential management.

This method does not require any credential management; credentials are automatically rotated. It has tighter integration with **Azure** security due to which security is enhanced as no secrets are stored in configuration files. It is also simpler to set up and maintain.

After the integration process is completed, you will see the following screen:

```PowerShell {1}
Integration Complete

VirtualMetric Target Configuration.

targets:
  - name: sentinel
    type: sentinel
    properties:
      endpoint: "https://<your-endpoint>"
      streams:
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"
        - name: "<table-name>"
          rule_id: "<rule-identifier>"

Press 's' to save the configuration to the current path, press 'q' to quit.
```

:::warning
The automation program does not automatically configure permissions for _Managed Identity_. You will need to manually assign the required permissions in **Azure Portal**.
:::

To assign the necessary permissions, follow these steps for each _Data Collection Rule_ (DCR) that starts with "`vmetric`":

1. Navigate to the DCR in the Azure Portal
2. Select **Access Control (IAM)**
3. Click **Add** > **Add role assignment**
4. Assign the `Monitoring Metrics Publisher` role to your Managed Identity

For **Azure VMs**, the _Managed Identity_ is automatically created with the VM. Use the VM's system-assigned identity name in role assignments.

For **Azure Arc**-enabled servers, ensure **Azure Arc** is properly configured on your server. Then, use the **Arc**-enabled server's system-assigned identity name in role assignments.

:::tip
If you encounter permission-related errors, verify that all required roles are properly assigned to your _Managed Identity_.
:::

## Configuration

From the configuration screen, copy the sentinel information by pressing <kb-short>S</kb-short> and paste it into a text editor like **Notepad**.

Create the following directory if it doesn't exist:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
  ```PowerShell
  C:\path\to\<vm_root>\director\config\targets
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
  ```bash
  ~/path/to/<vm_root>: ./director/config/targets
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After this, you have two options:

- create a new file named `sentinel.yml`, and paste the _properties_ block you have copied from the screen
- move your saved `sentinel.yml` file containing the copied _properties_ block to this directory

## Validation

Once the editing of properties is completed, validate the automation with the following steps:

1. Open your browser and navigate to **Azure Portal: Data Collection Rules (DCR)**
2. Look for DCRs with the "`vmetric`" prefix
3. In each DCR's details page, check the **Data Sources** section to verify that the tables were created correctly
