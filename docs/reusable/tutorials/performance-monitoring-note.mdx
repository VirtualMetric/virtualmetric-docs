:::info Performance Monitoring
Monitor these key performance indicators during operation:

- **Throughput**: Events processed per second
- **Latency**: End-to-end processing time
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and disk utilization
- **Error Rates**: Failed processing and retry attempts
- **Queue Depths**: Buffer utilization and potential bottlenecks

Consider implementing alerts for performance degradation and capacity planning based on growth trends.
