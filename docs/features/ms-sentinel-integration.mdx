# Microsoft Sentinel Integration

**VirtualMetric Director**'s pipeline engine was specifically crafted to integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Sentinel.

By inferring context from log messages, our solution automatically ingests data into the appropriate ASIM tables, drastically reducing the manual effort and accelerating integration.

With contextual filters, users can easily optimize data ingestion to ensure only relevant information is sent to Sentinel, saving time and reducing costs by increasing efficiency.
