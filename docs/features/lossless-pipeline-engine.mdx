# Lossless Pipeline Engine

**VirtualMetric Director**'s _Write-Ahead Log_ (WAL) architecture provides a robust foundation for data integrity by securely storing all routing and pipeline states on disk. This ensures zero data loss, even in the event of a crash. Unlike solutions that require additional components like Kafka, **VirtualMetric Director** caps log duplication at just one message.

The _WAL_ approach also minimizes the risk of system downtime, ensuring that your telemetry pipeline is always up and running, and consistent, even under heavy loads.
