# Datasets

**VirtualMetric Director** is revolutionizing the traditional concept of _source_ in telemetry pipelines with its introduction of _Datasets_.

Unlike classic solutions that focus solely on data collection via protocols or third-party agents, _Datasets_ categorize telemetry data&mdash;Windows Event Logs, Windows User Activity, Linux Audit Logs&mdash;at the source, simplifying pipeline design and enabling advanced RBAC.

With _Datasets_, users can define role-based access at the data level to ensure that the teams working on the same source are fully isolated and unable to view each other's data. This innovative approach delivers greater flexibility and tighter security.
