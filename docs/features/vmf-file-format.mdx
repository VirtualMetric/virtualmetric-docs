# VMF 3.0: The Next-Gen File Format for Pipelines

**VirtualMetric File Format** (VMF) 3.0 is a state-of-the-art file format engineered specifically for high-performance pipeline engines.

With its roots in **Apache** Avro, **VMF** combines the efficiency of a row-based format with the ability to handle massive volumes of small data chunks. Its advanced design enables disk-level merging without consuming system resources, overcoming the limitations of **Avro OCF** which requires the presence of resources for merging compressed files.

**VMF** achieves up to **99%** compression, making it ideal for both storage and network transport. It also supports features like _Bloom Filters_, _Zero Trust Storage_, _Log Chaining_, and _TSA_ out of the box, making it the ultimate file format for forensic integrity, fast searches, and secure data handling.
