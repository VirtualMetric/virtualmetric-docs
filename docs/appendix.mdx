## Synopsis Key

**Director** uses YAML files to configure processors, and plurals of type specifiers uses YAML syntax for plurals where multiple items can be specified
	* within a pair of brackets (`[]`) and separated by a comma (`,`)&mdash;e.g.
		```code
			["A", "B", ...]
		```
	* on a line-item basis with a `-` at the beginning&mdash;e.g.
		```code
			- "A"
			- "B"
			- ...
		```
