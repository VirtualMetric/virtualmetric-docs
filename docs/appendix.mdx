## Synopsis Type Specifiers

To configure processors, **Director** uses YAML files in which plurals are represented either as comma-separated lists of items within a pair of brackets&mdash;e.g.

```code
["A", "B", ...]
```

or as multi-line lists with `-` indicating entries&mdash;e.g.

```code
- "A"
- "B"
- ...
```

---

**any** Any value that can be represented by alphanumeric strings

**char** _sing_. A text character.<br/>
> _plu_. **chars...** Can be a quoted string in which case the string is interpreted as an array of characters.

**date** A time value based on an internationally recognized format

**enumerated** A value from a specific number of pre-defined options&mdash;e.g. locale identifiers such as `en` or `fr`, date format specifiers such as `d`, `M`, or `y`  etc.

**id** Identity value for a type. `""` for strings, `0` for numeric values, `[]` for lists.

**ident** _sing_. Identifier or unquoted alphanumeric string. Must start with uppercase or lowercase characters (`A...Z` or `a...z`), can contain alphabetic or numeric characters (`0...9`), and `_` or `-`
> _plu_. **idents...** One or more identifiers.

**numeric** A value that can be represented by numeric characters (`0...9`)

**logical** A boolean value, i.e. `true` or `false`

**processor** _sing_. One of the available processors.
> _plu_. **processors...** One or more processors.

**regex** A regular expression&mdash;e.g.
	```code
	_ingest.vendor.id =~ "fr-\w+\s+"
	```

**string** _sing_. Quoted string. Can contain any text character.
> _plu_. **strings...** One or more quoted strings separated by whitespace (e.g. &blank;) or a delimiter (e.g. `,`).

**script** A quoted string containing expressions that can be evaluated by an interpreter&mdash;e.g.
	```code
	_ingest.vendor.ip != null
	```
**shape** A standard shape description, such as `GeoJSON`, used for maps.
