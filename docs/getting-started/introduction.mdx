# Getting Started: Introduction

Welcome to **VirtualMetric DataStream**. This section will help you deploy your product and get started using it.

## Suite

**DataStream** is a telemetry pipeline solution that simplifies data collection, data processing, and data routing for **Microsoft Sentinel** and other **Azure** data services. It uses pipelines to process, enrich, and direct data flows to their optimal destinations. 

The product suite contains the following applications:

- **Director** - see [this section](../about/applications.mdx#virtualmetric-director) for a more detailed description.

	The primary workhorse of our system. It contains the engine that, using a multi-layered configuration setup, ingests massive data from multiple sources, then processes, transforms,and enriches that data based on a very flexible and composable logic, and then routes them in order to forward the processed data to multiple destinations.

- **Agent** - see [this section](../about/applications.mdx#virtualmetric-agent) for a more detailed description.

	The component that enables completely centralized and unattended management of **Directors** deployed to thousands of machines. Reconfiguring the data flows streamed on whole slews of machines and multiple networks have never been easier.

## Deployment

Before you proceed, please review our [**Deployment Models**](../deployment/overview.mdx#models) to see your options.

Here, we will use **Single Node Deployment**&mdash;i.e. we will deploy on a single machine as this is the simplest and most straightforward.

We recommend that you keep all **VirtualMetric** executables in the same directory, preferably named `VirtualMetric`. You can create that directory in advance:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
	```PowerShell
	New-Item -Path "C:\Program Files\VirtualMetric" -ItemType Folder
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
	```bash
	mkdir /opt/VirtualMetric
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
	```bash
	mkdir /Applications/VirtualMetric
	```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Throughout the documentation, we will refer to this folder as `<vm_root>`. Once you have created your installation folder, you can deploy the applications.

## Downloads

- [Download and install **Director**](./single-node-deployment-director.mdx).

	If you chose to deploy manually, make sure to create the following folders under `<vm_root>`:

	<Tabs>
		<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
		```PowerShell
		New-Item -Path "<vm_root>\config\devices","<vm_root>\config\targets","<vm_root>\config\routes" -ItemType Directory -Force
		```
		</TabItem>
		<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
		```bash
		mkdir -p <vm_root>/config/{devices,targets,routes}
		```
		</TabItem>
		<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
		```bash
		mkdir -p <vm_root>/config/{devices,targets,routes}
		```
		</TabItem>
	</Tabs>

	With the script-based online installation, this directory tree&mdash;as well as other default folders&mdash;are created automatically.

- [Download and install **Agent**](./single-node-deployment-agent.mdx).

:::tip
If you want to be able to access the executables from any directory, make sure to add `<vm_root>` to your `$PATH` environment variable. This can be done easily through a terminal:

	<Tabs>
		<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
		```PowerShell
		$Env:PATH += "C:\Program Files\VirtualMetric"
		```
		</TabItem>
		<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
		```bash
		export PATH=$PATH:/opt/virtualmetric
		```
		</TabItem>
		<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
		```bash
		export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/VirtualMetric
		```
		</TabItem>
	</Tabs>

After completing the above, you can proceed to the [**Examples**](./examples/overview.mdx) to review various scenarios demonstrating how our powerful applications work.
