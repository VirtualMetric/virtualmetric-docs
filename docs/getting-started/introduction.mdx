# Getting Started: Introduction

Welcome to **VirtualMetric DataStream**. This section will help you deploy your product and get started using it.

## The Applications

**DataStream** is a telemetry pipeline solution that simplifies data collection, data processing, and data routing for **Microsoft Sentinel** and other **Azure** data services. It uses pipelines to process, enrich, and direct data flows to their optimal destinations. 

The package contains the following applications:

- **Director** - see [this section](../about/applications.mdx#virtualmetric-director) for a more detailed description.

- **Agent** - see [this section](../about/applications.mdx#virtualmetric-agent) for a more detailed description.

## Deployment

Before you proceed, please review our [**Deployment Models**](../deployment/overview.mdx#models) to see your options.

Here, we will use **Single Node Deployment**&mdash;i.e. we will deploy on a single machine as this is the simplest and most straightforward.

We recommend that you keep all **VirtualMetric** executables in the same directory, preferably named `VirtualMetric`:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
	```PowerShell
	C:\Program Files\VirtualMetric
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
	```PowerShell
	./opt/VirtualMetric
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
	```PowerShell
	/Applications/VirtualMetric
	```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Throughout our documentation, we will refer to this folder as `<vm_root>`. Once you have created your installation folder, you can deploy the applications:

- [Download and install **Director**](./single-node-deployment.mdx#director).

- [Download and install **Agent**](./single-node-deployment.mdx#agent).

If you chose to deploy manually, make sure to create the following folder under `<vm_root>`:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
	```PowerShell
	mkdir <vm_root>\config
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
	```PowerShell
	mkdir <vm_root>/config
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
	```PowerShell
	mkdir <vm_root>/config
	```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

With online (script-based) installation, the `config` directory as well as other default folders are created automatically.

:::tip
If you want to be able to access the executables from any directory, make sure to add `<vm_root>` to your `$PATH` environment variable.

After completing the above, you can proceed to the [**Examples**](./examples/overview.mdx).
