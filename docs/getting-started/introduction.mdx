# Getting Started: Introduction

Welcome to **VirtualMetric DataStream**. This section will help you deploy your product and get started using it.

Here are the steps to get started:

1. Before you proceed, please review our [**Deployment Models**](./deployment/overview.mdx#models) to see your options.

    To deploy **locally**, see the [**On Local**](./deployment/on-local.mdx) section of the chapter.

    To deploy **on cloud**, see the relevant sections for **Azure** in the same chapter.

    Here, we will deploy **on premises** as server&mdash;for **Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Copilot+** (ARM64).

2. Once you have decided on your deployment model and chosen the location that suits you, use the relevant sections to install the binaries and make the required settings.

    To deploy as clusters, see the [**As Cluster**](./deployment/as-cluster.mdx) section in the same chapter.

    Here, we will use [**Single Node Deployment**](./director-single-node-deployment.mdx)&mdash;i.e. we will deploy on a single machine as this is simplest and most straightforward.

    - First, download and install **Director**.

    - To simulate streaming data, we provide **Director**'s companion utility **Generator**. It can be used to send messages to specific logging services, although other traditional tools&mdash;such as `logger`&mdash;can also be used for this purpose on some **Unix**-based platforms.

        :::tip
        Make sure to download and install **Generator** since will be using it in our introductory examples.
        :::

    - Finally, download and install **Agent**.

    We recommend that you keep all three executables in the same directory, preferably named `VirtualMetric`.

    :::note
    For convenience, you may want to add **VirtualMetric**'s installation folder to your `$PATH` environment variable in order to be able to invoke the executable from any directory.

    However, throughout this documentation, we will use the platform-specific syntax for running apps not on the `$PATH`, i.e. we will prepend "`.\`" for Windows, and "`./`" for Unix-based systems to the binary's name.    
    :::

3. To configure telemetry streams, **DataStream** uses YAML files.

    **Director** parses all the YAML files found under the `<vm_root>/config` folder and runs them. It ignores the filenames you use since that is only for your convenience: to organize your components as you see fit.

    :::warning
    On **Windows**, make sure file extensions are visible. To check this, go to **File Explorer** and select **View > Show > File name extensions**. This is to avoid surprises like the system adding another extension to your YAML file's extension, e.g. `file.yml.txt` in which **VirtualMetric** executables will not be able to recognize them.
    :::

    However, if your files are _not_ placed under `<vm_root>/config` or in one of the subfolders created under it by default during the installation (e.g. `<vm_root>/config/devices` or `<vm_root>/config/pipelines`) , then these are considered _standalone_ files and you _do_ have to specify their paths and filenames on the command line.

    :::tip
    For more details on the management of files, review [**this section**](../configuration/overview.mdx#managing-yaml-files).
    :::

    <a id="working-directory"/>
    For our purposes, and to keep things simple, we will be using the following folder as our working directory:

        <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
            ```powershell
            C:\Path\To\<vm_root>\config\Examples
            ```
        </TabItem>    
        <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
            On **Linux**:

            ```bash
            /usr/bin/path/to/<vm_root>/config/Examples
            ```
            On **macOS**:

            ```bash
            /Applications/Path/To/<vm_root>/config/Examples
            ```
        </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

    We will be saving all our configuration files in this folder. We will also specify our output files to be created here.

    :::warning
    As we will place all our files in this directory, they will be considered _standalone_ files and we will have to provide their path and names on the command line.
    :::

5. Finally, a simple configuration for logging is in order for you to be able to check the status of your runs.

    * Go to `<vm_root>` (i.e. the folder where you have placed **VirtualMetric**)
    * Find the `config` directory, which is directly under `<vm_root>`
    * Open the file named `vmetric.yml`, -or- create it if it doesn't exist
    * Make sure the settings match the following, -or- add them to the newly created file:

        ```yaml
        debug:
        log:
            status: true
        level: 4
        console:
            status: true
        ```

    **Director** will generate the log of your runs and place it in the following file:

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
        ```powershell
        C:\Path\To\<vm_root>\storage\logs\debug.log
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
        For **Linux**:

        ```bash
        /usr/bin/path/to/<vm_root>/storage/logs/debug.log
        ```
        For **macOS**:

        ```bash
        /Applications/Path/To/<vm_root>/storage/logs/debug.log
        ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Deleting this file is harmless. So long as the above debugging setting remains, it will be re-created with each run.

6. Once you are done with the above, you can proceed to the following **Examples** to explore the basics of configuring telemetry flows and see **Director** in action.
