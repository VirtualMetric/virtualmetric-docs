# Getting Started: Introduction

Welcome to **VirtualMetric DataStream**. This section will help you deploy your product and get started using it.

Here are the steps to get started:

1. Before you proceed, please review our [**Deployment Models**](./deployment/overview.mdx#models) to see your options.

    To deploy **locally**, see the [**On Local**](./deployment/on-local.mdx) section of the chapter.

    To deploy **on cloud**, see the relevant sections for **Azure** in the same chapter.

    Here, we will deploy **on premises** as server&mdash;for **Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Copilot+** (ARM64).

2. Once you have decided on your deployment model and chosen the location that suits you, use the relevant sections to install the binaries and make the required settings.

    To deploy as clusters, see the [**As Cluster**](./deployment/as-cluster.mdx) section in the same chapter.

    Here, we will use [**Single Node Deployment**](./director-single-node-deployment.mdx)&mdash;i.e. we will deploy on a single machine as this is simplest and most straightforward.

    After completing your deployment, consider the following:

    :::tip
    For convenience, you may want to add **VirtualMetric**'s installation folder to your `$PATH` environment variable in order to be able to invoke the executable from any directory.
    
    However, throughout this documentation, we will use the platform-specific syntax for running apps not on the `$PATH`, i.e. we will prepend "`.\`" for Windows, "`./`" for Unix-based systems to the binary's name.
    :::

3. To configure telemetry streams, **DataStream** uses YAML files.

    {/* TODO: Add content */}

    :::warning
    On **Windows**, make sure you have made file extensions visible by going to **File Explorer** and selecting **View > Show > File name extensions** in order to avoid surprises like the system adding another extension after your YAML file's extension, e.g. `file.yml.txt`.
    :::

    **Director** parses all the YAML files found under the `<vm_root>/config` folder and runs them. It ignores the filenames you use since that is only for your convenience: to organize your components as you see fit.
    
    However, if your files are _not_ placed under `<vm_root>/config` or in one of the subfolders created under it by default during the installation (e.g. `<vm_root>/config/devices` or `<vm_root>/config/pipelines`) , then these are considered _standalone_ files and you _do_ have to specify their paths and filenames on the command line.

    :::tip
    For more details, review [**this section**](../configuration/overview.mdx#managing-yaml-files).
    :::

4. To simulate sample data streams, we provide **Director**'s companion utility: **Generator**. A typical use of it will be sending messages to a specific logging service, although other traditional tools can also be used for this on some Unix-based platforms:

    {/* TODO: Add procedure to download and install **Generator** */}

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
        ```powershell
        vmetric-generator -mode=syslog -address="127.0.0.1:514" -message="Text message"
        ```
    </TabItem>    
    <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
        ```bash
        logger -n 127.0.0.1 -P 514 "Text message"
        ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Press <kb-short>Ctrl+C</kb-short> to terminate either program and exit the process.

5. For our purposes, and to keep things simple, we will be using the following folder as our working directory:

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
        ```powershell
        C:\Path\To\<vm_root>\config\Examples
        ```
    </TabItem>    
    <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
        On **Linux**:

        ```bash
        /usr/bin/path/to/<vm_root>/config/Examples
        ```
        On **macOS**:

        ```bash
        /Applications/Path/To/<vm_root>/config/Examples
        ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    We will be saving all our configuration files in this folder. We will also specify our output files to be created here.

6. Finally, a simple configuration for logging is in order for you to be able to check the status of your runs.

    * Go to `<vm_root>` (i.e. the folder where you have placed **VirtualMetric**)
    * Find the `config` directory, which is directly under `<vm_root>`
    * Open the file named `vmetric.yml`, -or- create it if it doesn't exist
    * Make sure the settings match the following, -or- add them to the newly created file:

        ```yaml
        debug:
        log:
            status: true
        level: 4
        console:
            status: true
        ```

    **Director** will generate the log of your runs and place it in the following file:

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
        ```powershell
        C:\Path\To\<vm_root>\storage\logs\debug.log
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
        For **Linux**:

        ```bash
        /usr/bin/path/to/<vm_root>/storage/logs/debug.log
        ```
        For **macOS**:

        ```bash
        /Applications/Path/To/<vm_root>/storage/logs/debug.log
        ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Deleting this file is harmless. So long as the above debugging setting remains, it will be re-created with each run.

7. Once you are done with the above, you can proceed to the following **Examples** to explore the basics of configuring telemetry flows and see **Director** in action.

    {/* FIXME: Modify content */}

    - [**Example: Ingesting Data**](./example-ingesting-data.mdx) - Configure your first device to receive streaming data

    - [**Example: Forwarding Data**](./example-forwarding-data.mdx) - Configure your first target to send streaming data

    - [**Example: A Syslog-To-Parquet Pipeline**](./example-a-syslog-to-parquet-pipeline.mdx) - A full, end-to-end pipeline in action

    - [**Example: Using Agents**](./example-using-agents.mdx) - Configure your first **Agent** for unattended execution
