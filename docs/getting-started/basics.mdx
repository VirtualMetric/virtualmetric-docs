# Getting Started: Basics

Management of **VirtualMetric Director** telemetry processes is done through configuration files in YAML format. In this chapter, we will give a brief summary of how these files are used and the minimum configurations required.

## Configuration Files

The configurations may be placed in separate files or they may be grouped together based on your requirements.

:::tip
You can place your files anywhere you wish under `config` since **Director** discovers them by traversing the subdirectories recursively.
:::

By default, the files reside in the directories under the `config` folder and have a `.yml` extension:

```mermaid
graph LR
    config --> devices
    config --> routes
    config --> targets
    devices --> syslog["syslog.yml"]
    routes --> default["default.yml"]
    targets --> console["console.yml"]
    targets --> file["file.yml"]
```

Choose the style that best fits your needs.

## Devices

Devices are data sources that collect or receive telemetry data. The required fields are:

- `id`: Unique numeric identifier
- `name`: Descriptive name
- `type`: Device type (e.g. `http`, `tcp`, `udp`, `syslog`, `estreamer`, `azmon`, `windows`)
- `properties`: Type-specific configuration settings

Use the `id` of the device to refer to it in your configurations.

**Example**:

```yaml
- devices:
  id: 1
  type: http
  properties:
    port: 8080
    content_type: "application/json"
```

You can organize your device files in two ways:

- Using standalone files

    <Tabs groupId="cli-options">
      <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
        ```PowerShell
        C:\Users\<user-name>\Documents\syslog.yml
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">  
        ```bash
        ~: syslog.yml
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

- Using listener-based groupings:

    <Tabs groupId="cli-options">
      <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
        ```PowerShell
        C:\path\to\<vm_root>\listeners\syslog.yml
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">  
        ```bash
        ~ ./path/to/<vm_root>/listeners/syslog.yml
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

Choose the one that best fits your needs.

:::tip
Each device type provides specific options detailed in its respective [chapter](/docs/configuration/devices/index.mdx).

## Targets

Targets define destinations where processed data is sent. The required fields are:

- `name`: Unique identifier
- `type`: Target type (destination system)
- `properties`: Type-specific configuration (connection details, authentication, etc.)

Use the `name` of the target to refer to it in your configurations.

**Example**:

```yaml
- targets:
    name: elasticsearch
    type: elasticsearch
    properties:
      hosts: ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]
      index: "logs-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
      username: "elastic"
      password: "${ES_PASSWORD}"
```

Your target files can be named as, e.g.

* `<vm_root>/config/target.yml`
* `<vm_root>/config/targets/outputs.yml`
* `<vm_root>/config/targets/outputs/sentinel.yml`

As the nesting level increases, file names become more specific, offering additional context for classification. Select the organizational method that best meets your requirements.

:::tip
Each target type provides specific options detailed in its respective [chapter](/docs/configuration/targets/index.mdx).
:::

Multiple targets can be used for redundancy, [normalization](/docs/configuration/pipelines/normalization.mdx) rules can be implemented, and alerts can be put in place for notifications and error handling.

For a general discussion, see the [overview](/docs/configuration/targets/index.mdx).

## Pipelines

Pipelines define data processing workflows with processors that transform and enrich data. The required fields are:

- `name`: Unique identifier
- `processors`: List of processors with their configurations

Use the `name` of the pipeline to refer to it in your configurations.

**Example**:

```yaml
- pipelines:
    name: checkpoint
    processors:
      - grok:
        field: message
        patterns:
          - "%{COMMONAPACHELOG}"
      - set:
        field: event.provider
        value: "checkpoint"
```

Pipelines can also access metadata available in processors. These are:

* `ctx`: Processing context
* `logEntry`: Log entry being processed
* `tag`: Identifier used for logging/tracking processor execution
* `params`: Map of parameters available to scripts

{/* TODO: Enlist */}

For a general discussion, see the [overview](/docs/configuration/pipelines/index.mdx).

## Routes

Routes define the flow of data from devices through pipelines to targets. The required fields are:

- `name`: Unique identifier
- `devices`: List of device IDs or patterns that match source devices
- `targets`: List of target IDs where data should be sent
- `pipelines`: (Optional) List of pipeline IDs for data processing

Use the `name` of the route to refer to it in your configurations.

The enlisted devices, targets, and pipelines must be pre-configured to be usable by routes. Use their ids or names to refer to them.

**Example**:

```yaml
- routes:
    name: syslog_to_backup
    devices: 
      - syslog_*
    pipelines: 
      - normalize
      - enrich
    targets: 
      - backup
```
