# Example: A Syslog-To-Sentinel Pipeline

This section will help you get started with configuring and running a pipeline, walking you through a common use case.

## Scenario

We will create a pipeline that ingests logs from a _Syslog_ source, selects certain items and categorizes them, and forwards them to **Microsoft Sentinel** in _Advanced Security Information Model_ (ASIM) format.

We will implement the following scenario:

|Step|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Create a device|Define the parameters of a `syslog` listener to receive messages. See the fields available in the [Syslog](../appendix.mdx#syslog) format|
|Create a target|Define the format for sending the messages to `sentinel` as the destination. See the fields available in the [ASIM](../appendix.mdx#asim) format|
|Speficy the processors|Using the `grok` processor, extract the `message` and `syslog.message` fields and map them to ASIM fields for routing|
|Define a route|Specify the _source_, the _destination_, and the _pipeline_ to be used|

## Setup

We must work in an environment that has access to _Syslog_ messages. We also need a **Microsoft Sentinel** workspace with proper permissions.

:::note
Before proceeding with the example, a simple configuration for logging is in order to check our results. Open the `vmetric.yml` file under `config` and add the following lines to it:

```yaml
debug:
  log:
    status: true
  level: 4
  console:
    status: true
```

This will generate the logs of the operation, and place them under the folder `<vm_root>/storage/logs`.
:::

## Configuration Files

For convenience, we will place all our configurations in a single file name `pipeline.yml`  and place it directly under `config`.

:::tip
When configuring the pipeline, devices are referred to with the numbers in their `id` parameters, whereas targets, routes, and other pipelines are referred to with the identifiers in their `name` parameters.
:::

## Step 1: Configure The Device

First, we have to define a device that will receive the log data. We will use the configuration we have created in our [ingesting data example](./example-ingesting-data.mdx) as our starting point, modifying it as fits our needs:

```yml
devices:
  - id: 1
    name: syslog_tcp
    type: syslog
    properties:
      protocol: tcp
      port: 1514
      framing: delimiter
      line_delimiter: "\n"
      buffer_size: 16384
      batch_size: 1000
```

Put this device configuration in your file.

This configuration will create a _TCP Syslog_ server listening on port `1514`. We have specfied the line feed character as the delimiter for message framing. We also set the appropriate buffer and batch sizes.

## Step 2: Configure The Target

Next, we will define a target for **Microsoft Sentinel** in our file, again using the configuration we have created in our [forwarding data example](./example-forwarding-data.mdx) as the basis:

```yml
targets:
  - name: sentinel_asim
    description: "Microsoft Sentinel ASIM target"
    type: sentinel
    properties:
      tenant_id: "${AZURE_TENANT_ID}"
      client_id: "${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}"
      client_secret: "${AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}"
      workspace_id: "${SENTINEL_WORKSPACE_ID}"
      format: asim
      batch_size: 100
      flush_interval: 60
```

With this configuration, we are setting up the authentication with **Azure** using environment variables. We have specified the target format as ASIM, and configured batching and flush intervals for optimal performance.

## Step 3: Create A Processing Pipeline

We are now ready to configure our pipeline. Put the following in our configuration file:

```yml
pipelines:
  - name: syslog_to_sentinel
    description: "Process Syslog data for Microsoft Sentinel ASIM"
    processors:
      - grok:
        field: message
        patterns:
          - "%{SYSLOGBASE} %{GREEDYDATA:syslog.message}"      
      - grok:
        field: syslog.message
        patterns:
          - "%{DATA:event.action} %{WORD:user.name} from %{IP:source.ip}"
        ignore_failure: true
      - set:
        field: event.kind
        value: event
      - script:
          lang: golang
          source: |
            package main
            func main() {
              if program, ok := logEntry["program"].(string); ok {
                switch program {
                case "sshd":
                  setField(logEntry, "event.category", []string{"authentication"})
                case "firewall":
                  setField(logEntry, "event.category", []string{"network"})
                default:
                  setField(logEntry, "event.category", []string{"process"})
                }
              }
            }
      - rename:
        fields:
          - from: timestamp
            to: event.created
          - from: source.ip
            to: src.ip
          - from: user.name
            to: user.name_orig      
      - remove:
        field:
          - syslog.message
          - message
        ignore_missing: true
```

This configuration will do the following:

* Parse the _Syslog_ header information using the [`grok`](../configuration/pipelines/processors/grok.mdx) processor&mdash;reading the fields `syslog.message`, `event.action`, `user.name`, and `source.ip`&mdash;and will extract authentication event details

* Set the common event metadata `event.kind`

* Using a script, categorize the events based on the type of `program` generating the log&mdash; as `authentication`, `network`, or `process`&mdash;and map the fields to the ASIM schema

* Clean up the temporary fields.

:::note
We chose to ignore failures and missing fields to avoid raising exceptions.
:::

## Step 4: Configure the Route

Finally, we have to create a route to connect our device to the pipeline and then to our target. Put the following definition in our configuration file:

```yml
routes:
  - name: syslog_to_sentinel_route
    description: "Route Syslog data to Microsoft Sentinel ASIM"
    devices:
      - name: syslog_server
    pipelines:
      - name: syslog_to_sentinel
    targets:
      - name: sentinel_asim
```

This configuration will connect to the _Syslog_ server, apply the `syslog_to_sentinel` pipeline to process the ingested data, and then send it to the **Microsoft Sentinel** ASIM target specified.

## Monitoring

Let's put it all together: we have defined a device and a target, configured a pipeline to specify how the data will be processed, and specified a route that will use this pipeline. At this point we have everything ready.

:::note
We will use the `mode` parameter to tell **Director** that we will run a "pipeline", and then use the pipeline's `name` parameter to specify it on the CLI.
:::

We will first validate the pipeline:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    ```PowerShell
    .\vmetric-director -mode=pipeline -name=syslog_to_sentinel -validate
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    ```bash
    ./vmetric-director -mode=pipeline -name=syslog_to_sentinel -validate
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
    ```bash
    ./vmetric-director -mode=pipeline -name=syslog_to_sentinel -validate
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When **Director** is invoked with the specified configuration file, it starts sending _Syslog_ messages to port `1514`.

Check the logs for any errors, and verify in **Microsoft Sentinel** that data is being received in the [ASIM](../appendix.mdx#asim) format.
