# Create a Director

## What is a Director?

A Director is the engine that processes your data flows. It receives data from your sources (Devices), processes it through pipelines, and sends it to your destinations (Targets). Think of it as the central orchestrator of your data pipeline.

Directors are installed in **your own infrastructure** (cloud or on-premises) and can operate in two modes:
- **Managed**: Fully controlled through the DataStream portal (configurations, updates, monitoring)
- **Self-Managed**: You download configurations and manage updates independently for enhanced security

For this getting started guide, we'll create a **Managed Director** that you can control through the portal while keeping it in your own environment.

## Create Your First Director

1. **Navigate to Directors**
   - From your Home dashboard, click **Fleet Management** → **Directors**
   - Or use the hamburger menu (top left) → **Fleet Management** → **Directors**

2. **Start Director Creation**
   - Click the blue **Create director** button
   - You'll see the **Director Setup** form

3. **Configure Basic Settings**
   - **Name**: Enter a unique name (e.g., "My First Director")
   - **Choose installation type**: Select **Standalone**

:::note
Standalone installation deploys Director on a single machine in your infrastructure. While this setup doesn't include backup or load balancing, it's perfect for getting started and learning DataStream.

4. **Create the Director Record**
   - Click **Create director**
   - This creates the Director configuration in DataStream
   - You'll see confirmation that the Director was added to your list

## Install the Director Software

Now you need to install the actual Director software on your infrastructure:

1. **Choose Your Environment**
   - **Cloud**: Azure VM, AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, etc.
   - **On-premises**: Physical server, virtual machine, container platform
   - **Requirements**: See [deployment options](/deployment/overview) for detailed requirements

2. **Get Installation Script**
   - The interface shows platform-specific installation scripts
   - Choose **PowerShell** (Windows) or **Bash** (Linux/macOS)
   - Copy the generated API key and script from the interface

3. **Run Installation Script**
   - Connect to your target server (cloud VM or on-premises)
   - Open a terminal window **with administrator privileges**
   - Paste the API key and script
   - Press Enter to run the installation
   - Wait for installation to complete (this takes a few minutes)

:::info Important
Ensure port **443** is open for outbound connections from your Director host. This allows the Director to communicate with DataStream's cloud portal for management and monitoring.
:::

4. **Verify Connection**
   - Click the **Verify connection** button in the DataStream interface
   - Wait for the "Connection successful" message
   - If connection fails, check network connectivity and firewall settings

5. **Complete Setup**
   - Click **Complete setup** to finish the process
   - Return to the Directors list

## Verify Your Director

You should now see your Director in the Directors table with:
- **Status**: Enabled
- **Connection Status**: Connected (green)
- **Platform Type**: Self-managed
- **Installation Type**: Standalone

If you see these indicators, your Director is ready to process data flows!

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues?**
- Verify port 443 is open for outbound traffic
- Check that your server can reach DataStream's cloud endpoints
- Ensure the installation script ran without errors
- Try the **Re-install director** option if needed

**Installation Problems?**
- Confirm you're running the terminal as administrator
- Check that your system meets the minimum requirements
- Verify internet connectivity during installation
- Review any error messages in the terminal output

## What's Next?

Your Director is now ready to manage data flows. Next, we'll add your first data source by creating a Device.
