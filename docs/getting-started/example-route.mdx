# Getting Started: Routes

This chapter will help you get started with routes to forward data to specific destinations, walking you through some common scenarios.

## Basic Setup

The simplest route that can be defined sends data directly without processing:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: basic_forward
    description: "Forward all logs to storage"
    targets:
      - name: storage
```

## Pipelines

### Single

We can add some basic processing with a pipeline before we forward the data:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: process_logs
    description: "Process and store logs"
    pipelines:
      - name: normalize_logs
    targets:
      - name: storage
```

### Multiple

Or we can process data with several pipelines:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: complex_processing
    description: "Multi-stage processing"
    pipelines:
      - name: normalize
      - name: enrich
      - name: aggregate
    targets:
      - name: analytics
```

## Selection

### Device-Based

We can route data from specific device types:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: syslog_route
    if: device.type == 'syslog'
    pipelines:
      - name: syslog_normalize
    targets:
      - name: syslog_storage

  - name: windows_route
    if: device.type == 'windows'
    pipelines:
      - name: windows_normalize
    targets:
      - name: windows_storage
```

### Dataset-Based

Or we can route it from specific datasets:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: security_dataset
    if: dataset.name == 'security_logs'
    pipelines:
      - name: security_process
    targets:
      - name: security_analytics

  - name: performance_dataset
    if: dataset.name == 'performance_metrics'
    pipelines:
      - name: metrics_process
    targets:
      - name: metrics_platform
```

### Multi-Target

The same data can be sent to multiple targets (mirroring):

```yaml
routes:
  - name: mirror_logs
    description: "Store logs in multiple locations"
    pipelines:
      - name: normalize
    targets:
      - name: primary_storage
      - name: backup_storage
      - name: analytics_platform
```

## Conditionals

### Simple

We can filter the data to be forwarded using conditions:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: firewall_logs
    description: "Process firewall logs"
    if: device.type == 'firewall'
    pipelines:
      - name: firewall_pipeline
    targets:
      - name: security_storage
```

### Complex

For specific scenarios, complex filtering can be applied:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: critical_errors
    if: log.severity == 'critical' && device.type == 'production'
    pipelines:
      - name: urgent_process
    targets:
      - name: alerts
      - name: storage
```

Verify that the route's conditions are correctly expressed and that the pipelines are configured, ensure that the targets are accessible, monitor the route's metrics, and review the logs.
