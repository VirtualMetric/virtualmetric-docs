# Getting Started: Management

**VirtualMetric Director** uses YAML files to configure and run its telemetry processes. In this chapter, we will give a brief summary of how these files are used to manage your data streams.

{/*

TODO: Add basic yaml configuration techniques, i.e.

* creating a device/target
  * what parameter are needed
  * how are they specified
* creating a pipeline
  * what components must a pipeline contain at minimum to be valid
* defining a route
  * what components are needed
  * how are they specified

Add the CLI parameters to be used to test

* devices
* targets
* pipelines
* routes
