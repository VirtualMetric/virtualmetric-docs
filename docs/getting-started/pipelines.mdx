# Quick Start: Pipelines

This chapter will help you get started with configuring and running pipelines, walking you through common scenarios.

:::note
For a general discussion, see our [overview](/docs/configuration/pipelines/index.mdx) chapter.
:::

## Configuration

- Explain the basic tasks to complete to configure a pipeline

### Creating A Pipeline

- Create a yaml file
- Place that file a directory (which one?)
- Enter the basic yaml fields to complete

### Defining Devices

- Configure a device (preferably use a pre-configured one)
- Explain what type of device it is and what data it will ingest
- Define a suitable preprocessing normalization logic

### Defining Targets

- Create a target (preferably use a pre-configured one)
- Explain what type of target it is and what it will do when writing/saving/storing data
- Define a suitable postprocessing normalization logic

### Defining Routes

- Create a route that will use the previously explained target to forward data to a specific destination
- Explain what types of destinations can be used

## Optimization

- Mention to most frequently used parameters available to optimize the pipeline
- Use comparisons between a few examples to demonstrate what is optimized and how

## Monitoring

- Check the streeams and logs that the pipeline produces to 
  - spot errors or potential sore points that require correction
  - aspects to optimize
