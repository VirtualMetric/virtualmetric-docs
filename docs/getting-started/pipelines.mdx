## Configuration

### Creating A Pipeline

Create a pipeline yaml file
Place that file a direcory (which one?)

### Defining Devices

Configure a device (preferably use a pre-configured one)
Explain what type of device it is and what data it will ingest
Define a suitable preprocessing normalization logic

### Defining Targets

Create a target (preferably use a pre-configured one)
Explain what type of target it is and what it will do when writing/saving/storing data
Define a suitable postprocessing normalization logic

### Defining Routes

Create a route that will use the previously explained target to forward data to a specific destination
Explain what types of destinations can be used

## Optimization

Demonstrate to most frequently used parameters available to optimize the pipeline

## Monitoring

Check the streeams and logs that the pipeline produces to spot errors or potential sore points that require correction or optimization
