# Example: Using Agents

This section shows how a typical **Agent** is configured.

## Director Configuration

Add a device configuration for **Director**:

```yaml
devices:
  - id: 1
    name: sample_agent
    type: windows
    status: true
    properties:
      type: agent 
    definitions:
      - id: 491591344758837249
      - id: 486227243115741541
```

:::tip
For definitions, see <Topic id="appendix-agent-ids">this section</Topic> of the Appendix.

You need to use only one of the YAML files mentioned. You can delete the ones you do not want to use.
:::

## Agent Configuration

Download `vmetric-agent.exe` to a folder. Then, create a `vmetric.yml` file in the same folder, and add the following configuration to it:

```yaml
device:
  id: 1
director:
  address: 192.168.1.200:8080
```

Here

- the `device.id` value will be the same as that is configured in **Director**'s `devices` section.
- the `director.address` value is the IP address for **Director**'s service server; replace with your server's
- the listening port is `8080`
