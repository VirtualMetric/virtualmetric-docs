# Example: [TITLE TBD - Agent Configuration Management]

**TODO: Implement the following after working out the details with team meeting**

## Basic Plan for Agent Configuration Management Example

### Purpose
Demonstrate **Agent**'s primary function as a configuration management helper that coordinates with **Director** for metadata/pipeline configuration tasks across large networks.

### Planned Structure

#### Scenario
- **Real-world problem**: Managing DataStream configurations across large networks (hundreds/thousands of machines)
- **Agent's role**: Configuration coordination with Director (not data transmission)
- **Value proposition**: Saves manual configuration work across enterprise networks

#### Setup and Trial (To be detailed)
- Agent configuration for cluster/manager sync capabilities
- Director coordination setup 
- Configuration propagation demonstration
- Verification of coordination functionality

#### Monitoring (To be detailed)
- How to verify Agent-Director coordination is working
- What to look for in logs
- Troubleshooting coordination issues

### Notes from Behavior Map Analysis
- Agent is a "configuration management helper"
- Supports cluster/manager synchronization modes
- Coordinates with Directors for metadata/pipeline configuration tasks
- Does NOT send telemetry data to Director for processing
- Value: Saves manual configuration work across hundreds/thousands of network machines
