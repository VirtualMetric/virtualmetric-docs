To avoid any confusion, delete all YAML files created in other examples. This guarantees that only our current configurations are run.

To execute the code examples, navigate to `<vm_root>`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
    ```powershell
    Set-Location <vm_root>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    ```bash
    cd <vm_root>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Filenames do not include the path to avoid variation in syntax for different platforms. All configuration files will be placed in our [working directory](./user-notes.mdx#working-directory).
