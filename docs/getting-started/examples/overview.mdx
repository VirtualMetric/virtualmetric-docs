# Examples: Overview

This chapter is intended to introduce you to the functionality of **Directory** by way providing of simple, illustrative examples.

The use case provided are indeed very simple in order not to confuse the uninitiated. However, there are few details you have be aware of while carrying out the step-by-step procedures.

## Configuration Files

To configure telemetry streams, **DataStream** uses YAML files.

:::warning
On **Windows**, make sure file extensions are visible. To check this, go to **File Explorer** and select **View > Show > File name extensions**.

This is to avoid surprises like the system adding another extension to your YAML file's extension, e.g. `file.yml.txt`, in which case **VirtualMetric** applications will not be able to recognize them.
:::

**Director** parses all the YAML files found under the `<vm_root>/config` folder and runs them. It ignores the filenames you use since that is only for your convenience: to organize your components as you see fit.

:::note
For more details on management of configuration files, review [this section](../../configuration/overview.mdx#managing-yaml-files).

## Working Directory 

For our purposes, and to keep things simple, we will be using the following folder as our working directory:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
    ```powershell
    mkdir <vm_root>\config\Examples
    ```
</TabItem>    
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    On **Linux**:

    ```bash
    mkdir <vm_root>/config/Examples
    ```
    On **macOS**:

    ```bash
    mkdir <vm_root>/config/Examples
    ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We will be saving all our configuration files in this folder. We will also specify our output files to be created here.

## Logging Setup

Finally, a simple logging setup is in order for you to be able to check the status of your runs.

* Go to `<vm_root>`, i.e. the folder where you have placed **VirtualMetric**
* Find the `config` directory, which is directly under it
* Open the file named `vmetric.yml`, -or- create it if it doesn't exist
* Make sure the settings in it match the following, -or- add them to the newly created one:

    ```yaml
    debug:
    log:
        status: true
    level: 4
    console:
        status: true
    ```

**Director** will generate the log of your runs and place it in the following file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
    ```powershell
    C:\Path\To\<vm_root>\storage\logs\debug.log
    ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    For **Linux**:

    ```bash
    /opt/<vm_root>/storage/logs/debug.log
    ```
    For **macOS**:

    ```bash
    /Applications/<vm_root>/storage/logs/debug.log
    ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Deleting this file is harmless. So long as the above debugging setting remains, it will be re-created with each run.

## Examples

You can now proceed to the examples to explore the basics of configuring telemetry flows and see **Director** in action.

- [**Example: Ingesting Data**](./example-ingesting-data.mdx) - Configure your first device to receive streaming data

- [**Example: Forwarding Data**](./example-forwarding-data.mdx) - Configure your first target to send streaming data

- [**Example: Reading JSON With a Pipeline**](./example-reading-json-with-a-pipeline.mdx) - Configure your first pipeline to receive and process data

- [**Example: A Syslog-To-Parquet Data Stream**](./example-a-syslog-to-parquet-data-stream.mdx) - A full, end-to-end data stream in action
