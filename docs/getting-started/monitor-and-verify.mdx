# Monitor and Verify

Your first DataStream pipeline should now be processing data. Let's verify everything is working correctly and show you how to monitor your data flows going forward.

## Check Director Status

Your Director manages all data processing, so let's ensure it's healthy:

1. **Navigate to Director Dashboard**
   - Go to **Fleet Management** → **Directors**
   - Click on your Director's name in the table

2. **Verify Connection Health**
   - **Connection Status**: Should show "Connected" with green indicator
   - **IP Address**: Should display your server's IP address
   - **Status**: Should show "Enabled"

3. **Review Activity Logs**
   - Click the **Activity Logs** tab
   - Look for recent activity entries showing:
     - Data processing messages
     - Route execution logs
     - Any error or warning messages
   - Recent timestamps indicate active processing

**Healthy Activity Log Examples:**
```
[2024-01-15 10:30:15] Device 'My First Syslog Device' received 5 messages
[2024-01-15 10:30:16] Pipeline 'syslog-parser' processed 5 events successfully  
[2024-01-15 10:30:16] Target 'My First File Target' wrote 5 events to file
```

## Verify Data Flow

Let's confirm data is moving through your complete pipeline:

### Check Device Activity

1. **Navigate to Your Device**
   - Go to **Fleet Management** → **Devices** → **Syslog**
   - Find your device in the table
   - Look for activity indicators or recent message counts

2. **Verify Network Connectivity**
   - Confirm your device is listening on the correct port (514)
   - Test network connectivity to your DataStream server
   - Ensure firewall rules allow inbound syslog traffic

### Examine Target Output

1. **Navigate to Output Directory**
   - Go to the file location you specified in your target
   - Look for JSON files with today's date pattern
   - Example: `logs-2024_01_15.json`

2. **Verify File Contents**
   Open a recent file to confirm proper data processing:

   **Raw syslog input:**
   ```
   <134>Jan 15 10:30:00 server1 application: User login successful
   ```

   **Processed JSON output:**
   ```json
   {
     "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
     "message": "User login successful",
     "host": {"name": "server1"},
     "process": {"name": "application"},  
     "log": {
       "level": "info",
       "syslog": {
         "facility": {"code": 16, "name": "local0"},
         "severity": {"code": 6, "name": "info"}
       }
     },
     "event": {
       "category": ["authentication"],
       "outcome": "success"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Check File Growth**
   - Monitor file sizes increasing over time
   - Verify new files are created daily (based on your naming template)
   - Confirm compression is working (files should be smaller than expected)

### Monitor Route Performance

1. **Return to Quick Routes**
   - Go to **Routes** → **Quick Routes**
   - Click on your route's blue rectangle to view details
   - Look for processing statistics or performance metrics

2. **Check for Processing Errors**
   - Review any error counts or warning indicators
   - Verify the route status shows as active/enabled
   - Confirm all components in the route are functioning

## Understanding Your Processed Data

### Data Structure

Your processed logs now have consistent structure:

**Core Fields:**
- `@timestamp`: Standardized ISO 8601 timestamp
- `message`: Original log message content
- `host.name`: Source system identifier
- `log.level`: Normalized severity (debug, info, warn, error)

**Event Classification:**
- `event.category`: Type of event (network, security, system)
- `event.action`: What happened (login, logout, connection)
- `event.outcome`: Result (success, failure, unknown)

**Source Information:**
- `log.syslog.facility`: System component that logged the event
- `log.syslog.severity`: Original syslog severity level
- Additional fields based on your specific pipeline template

### Data Quality Indicators

**Good data processing shows:**
- Consistent field structure across all events
- Proper timestamp parsing and formatting
- Meaningful categorization in event fields
- No parsing errors or null values in critical fields

**Potential issues to watch for:**
- Missing or malformed timestamps
- Unparsed message content (indicates pipeline issues)
- Excessive null values (suggests data format mismatch)
- Processing errors in Director logs

## Performance Monitoring

### System Health Indicators

1. **Director Resource Usage**
   - Monitor CPU and memory consumption
   - Watch disk space in target directories
   - Check network connectivity stability
   - Review processing throughput rates

2. **Data Volume Metrics**
   - Messages processed per second
   - File size growth rates
   - Processing latency (time from receipt to output)
   - Error rates and retry counts

3. **Storage Management**
   - Target directory disk space usage
   - File rotation and cleanup requirements  
   - Compression effectiveness
   - Backup and archival needs

### Success Indicators

Your setup is working correctly when you see:
- ✅ Director status shows "Connected"
- ✅ New JSON files appear regularly in target directory
- ✅ Files contain properly structured, parsed log data
- ✅ Data appears consistently (matching your log source frequency)
- ✅ No error messages in Director Activity Logs
- ✅ Processing latency remains acceptable for your needs

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Data Appearing

**Check data sources:**
1. Verify log sources are sending to correct IP address and port
2. Test network connectivity: `telnet <server-ip> 514`
3. Check firewall rules allow inbound traffic on port 514
4. Confirm syslog sources are configured and operational

**Verify DataStream configuration:**
1. Ensure device status is "Enabled" 
2. Confirm route is properly saved and active
3. Check Director connection status
4. Review target directory permissions

### Data Looks Incorrect

**Pipeline issues:**
1. Verify you selected correct pipeline template for your log format
2. Review pipeline configuration in **My Pipelines**
3. Check if custom parsing rules are needed
4. Consider pipeline customization for unique log structures

**Format mismatches:**
1. Compare raw input vs expected pipeline input format
2. Test with known-good sample data
3. Review pipeline documentation for supported formats
4. Contact support if standard templates don't fit your data

### Performance Problems

**Processing bottlenecks:**
1. Check Director system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
2. Monitor network bandwidth if processing remote logs
3. Consider adjusting batch sizes in device/target configurations
4. Review processing volume vs system capacity

**Storage issues:**
1. Monitor disk space in target directories
2. Implement file rotation or cleanup policies
3. Consider compression settings optimization
4. Plan for data archival or deletion policies

## Next Steps for Operations

**Daily Monitoring:**
- Review Director health and connectivity
- Check data processing volumes and rates
- Monitor target storage usage and file creation
- Watch for error messages or processing failures

**Weekly Review:**
- Analyze data quality and completeness
- Review processing performance trends
- Check system resource utilization
- Plan capacity adjustments if needed

**Ongoing Optimization:**
- Customize pipeline processing for your specific needs
- Add additional data sources as requirements grow
- Implement alerting for critical processing failures
- Document your configuration for team knowledge sharing
