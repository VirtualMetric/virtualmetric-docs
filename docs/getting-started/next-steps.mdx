# Next Steps

Your basic **DataStream** pipeline is successfully processing data! Here's how to expand and customize your deployment to meet growing requirements.

## Customize Your Pipeline

Your installed template provides excellent baseline functionality, but you can customize it for your specific needs:

### Access Pipeline Configuration
- **Navigate to**: **My Pipelines**
- **Find your pipeline**: Click on your installed Content Hub template
- **Edit configuration**: Switch to **Pipeline Overview** tab and click the <gui>edit</gui> (pencil) icon

### Common Customizations

**Add Field Mapping:**
```yaml
# Map custom fields to standard names
- rename:
    field: src_ip
    target_field: source.ip
- rename:
    field: dst_ip  
    target_field: destination.ip
```

**Include Data Filtering:**
```yaml
# Drop debugging messages
- drop:
    if: 'log.level == "debug"'

# Keep only security events
- drop:
    if: 'event.category != "security"'
```

**Add GeoIP Enrichment:**
```yaml
# Add geographic information for IP addresses
- geoip:
    field: source.ip
    target_field: source.geo
```

**Custom Field Parsing:**
```yaml
# Parse custom application logs
- grok:
    field: message
    patterns:
      - "User %{USERNAME:user.name} performed %{WORD:event.action} on %{DATA:file.path}"
```

### Create Child Pipelines

Break complex processing into modular components:

1. **Add Child Pipeline**:
   - Click <gui>Add new child pipeline</gui> in your main pipeline
   - Name it descriptively (e.g., "security-event-enrichment")

2. **Delegate Specific Tasks**:
   - Route certain log types to specialized processing
   - Handle different data formats with dedicated parsers
   - Separate enrichment logic from core parsing

3. **Chain Pipeline Processing**:
   ```yaml
   # In main pipeline, call child pipeline
   - pipeline:
       name: security-event-enrichment
       if: 'event.category == "security"'
   ```

- **Query Language**: Powerful KQL for interactive data exploration
- **Visualization**: Built-in charts, graphs, and dashboard creation

### Parallel Processing Through Multiple Routes

To send data to multiple destinations, create separate routes for each target destination rather than configuring multiple targets within a single route.

**Creating Multiple Routes for Same Data:**

1. **Create First Route**
   - **Route name**: "security-to-sentinel"
   - **Devices**: Select your security log devices
   - **Selected pipeline**: Choose your security processing pipeline
   - **Target**: Microsoft Sentinel

2. **Create Second Route**
   - **Route name**: "security-to-storage"
   - **Devices**: Select the same security log devices
   - **Selected pipeline**: Choose the same security processing pipeline
   - **Target**: Azure Blob Storage

3. **Create Third Route** (if needed)
   - **Route name**: "security-to-analytics"
   - **Devices**: Select the same security log devices
   - **Selected pipeline**: Choose the same security processing pipeline
   - **Target**: Azure Data Explorer

**Route Strategy Options:**

**Quick Routes for Simple Scenarios:**
- Use Quick Routes when sending the same processed data to multiple destinations
- Duplicate route configuration with different target selections
- Suitable for basic parallel processing needs

**Advanced Routes for Complex Scenarios:**
- Use Advanced Routes when different destinations need different filtering
- Apply specific conditions for each destination
- Example: Send high-severity events to real-time alerting, all events to storage

**Advanced Route with Filtering:**
```yaml
# Route 1: Critical events to real-time target
- Route name: "critical-alerts"
- Filter: log.level == "error" || event.severity == "high"
- Target: Real-time alerting system

# Route 2: All events to archive storage
- Route name: "complete-archive"  
- Filter: (no filter - processes all events)
- Target: Long-term storage
```

This approach ensures each route handles one specific data flow path, making configuration clearer and troubleshooting simpler.
