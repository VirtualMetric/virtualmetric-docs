# Example: Processing Data

This chapter will get you started with processors, walking you through a common use case.

## Scenario

We will create a pipeline that processes the data points it receives with multiple processors, and sends the results to a the console.

## Prerequisites

We must work in an environment that has access to _Syslog_ messages. 

:::note
Before proceeding with the example, a simple configuration for logging is in order to check our results. Open the `vmetric.yml` file under `config` and add the following lines to it:

```yaml
debug:
  log:
    status: true
  level: 4
  console:
    status: true
```

This will generate the logs of the operation, and place them under the folder `<vm_root>/storage/logs`.
