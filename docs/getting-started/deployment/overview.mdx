# Deployment: Overview

**DataStream** offers flexible deployment options to match your specific infrastructure requirements. Whether you're running on local hardware, cloud virtual machines, or managed services, **DataStream** can be deployed in a way that optimizes performance and minimizes operational overhead.

- To deploy **locally**, see the [**On Local**](./on-local.mdx) section of the chapter.

- To deploy **on cloud**, see the relevant sections for **Azure** in the same chapter. Here, we will deploy **on premises** as server&mdash;for **Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Copilot+** (ARM64).

- To deploy as clusters, see the [**As Cluster**](./as-cluster.mdx) section in the same chapter.

Once you have decided on your deployment model and chosen the location that suits you, use the relevant sections to install the binaries and make the required settings.

## Models

**DataStream** supports the following deployment models:

|Deployment Type|Description|Use Case|
|--:|:--|:--|
|[**Local**](./on-local.mdx)|Run **DataStream** on your own hardware|Development, testing, or small-scale deployments|
|[**Azure VM**](./on-azure-vm.mdx)|Deploy on Azure Virtual Machines|Production workloads with custom configurations|
|[**Azure App Service**](./on-azure-app-service.mdx)|Run as a managed service|Simplified operations with automatic scaling|
|[**Azure Functions**](./on-azure-functions.mdx)|Event-driven serverless deployment|Cost-effective processing of intermittent workloads|
|[**Azure Arc Extension**](./via-azure-arc-extension.mdx)|Deploy to hybrid or multi-cloud environments|Consistent management across diverse infrastructure|

## Prerequisites

Before deploying **DataStream**, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - CPU: 2+ cores (4+ recommended for production)
  - RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB+ recommended for production)
  - Storage: 20GB minimum for the application

- **Software Requirements**:
  - Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, RHEL 8+), Windows Server 2019+
  - .NET Runtime: 6.0 or later

- **Network Requirements**:
  - Inbound ports: Based on configured collectors (e.g., 514 for Syslog)
  - Outbound connectivity to your storage and analytics services

## Choosing the Right Model

Consider these factors when selecting a deployment option:

1. **Data Volume**: Higher volumes may require VM-based deployments for maximum performance
2. **Operational Overhead**: Managed services reduce maintenance but may have configuration limitations
3. **Cost Model**: Serverless options can be cost-effective for variable workloads
4. **Integration Requirements**: Some deployment options offer better integration with existing systems
5. **Security Requirements**: Different deployment models have different security boundaries

## Process

Regardless of the deployment model, the general process follows these steps:

1. **Prepare Environment**: Set up the target infrastructure and dependencies
2. **Configure DataStream**: Define collectors, pipelines, and output destinations
3. **Deploy Application**: Install **DataStream** using the appropriate method
4. **Verify Operation**: Check logs and metrics to ensure proper functioning
5. **Monitor and Scale**: Adjust resources based on actual usage patterns

## Next Steps

Choose the deployment model that best fits your needs from the navigation menu. Each section provides detailed, model-specific instructions for setting up **DataStream**.
