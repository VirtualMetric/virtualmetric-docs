# Connect Everything with Routes

## What are Routes?

Routes define the data flow path in DataStream. They connect your components in this sequence:

**Device** (data source) → **Pipeline** (processing logic) → **Target** (destination)

Think of routes as the "wiring" that makes your data pipeline functional. Without a route, your device might receive data and your target might be ready to store it, but there's no path connecting them through your processing pipeline.

Routes also provide additional capabilities:
- **Filtering**: Process only specific types of data
- **Conditional routing**: Send different data to different targets
- **Load balancing**: Distribute processing across multiple directors
- **Error handling**: Route failed processing to alternate targets

## Create Your First Quick Route

Quick Routes provide a visual canvas for connecting your components:

1. **Navigate to Quick Routes**
   - From Home: **Routes** → **Quick Routes**  
   - Or hamburger menu → **Quick Routes**

2. **Understanding the Interface**
   - **Left sidebar**: Device and target selection buttons (if this is your first route)
   - **Main canvas**: Visual workspace where you'll connect components
   - **Connected components**: Will appear on canvas after selection

## Select Your Components

### Add Your Device

1. **Click Select Device** (left sidebar)
2. **Choose Selection Method**:
   
   **Select Device Tab:**
   - Shows existing devices you can connect
   - Check the box next to "My First Syslog Device" 
   - Click **Select Device(s)**
   
   **OR Choose Device Type Tab:**
   - Lets you create a new device directly
   - Click **Choose device type** if you need a new device
   - Follow the creation process, then return to route setup

3. **Verify Device on Canvas**
   - Your syslog device appears as a card on the left side of the canvas
   - Click on the device card to select it
   - The vertical ellipsis (⋮) provides options to view details or remove the device

### Add Your Target

1. **Click Select Target** (left sidebar)
2. **Choose Selection Method**:

   **Select Target Tab:**
   - Shows existing targets you can connect
   - Check the box next to "My First File Target"
   - Click **Select Target(s)**

   **OR Choose Target Type Tab:**
   - Lets you create a new target directly  
   - Click **Choose target type** if you need a new target
   - Follow the creation process, then return to route setup

3. **Verify Target on Canvas**
   - Your file target appears as a card on the right side of the canvas
   - Click on the target card to select it
   - The vertical ellipsis (⋮) provides options to view details or remove the target

## Connect Device to Target

1. **Start the Connection**
   - Your cursor changes to a crosshair when components are ready
   - Click the **connector handle** on the right side of your device card
   - Drag to the **connector handle** on the left side of your target card

2. **Route Configuration Modal**
   - A modal appears asking about pipeline configuration
   - You have two options:

   **Discard Route:**
   - Click this if you made a mistake or want to cancel

   **Insert Pipeline:**
   - Click **Insert pipeline within the route** 
   - This opens the pipeline selection modal

3. **Select Your Pipeline**
   - **Search pipelines**: Type to filter available pipelines
   - **Find your installed template**: Look for the pipeline you installed from Content Hub
   - **Select pipeline**: Check the box next to your pipeline name
   - **Confirm selection**: Click **Select pipeline**

4. **Review the Connection**
   - The modal closes and shows a dotted line connecting device → target
   - A blue square with **+** appears in the middle of the connection line
   - A **Selected pipeline** window appears at the bottom showing your chosen pipeline

5. **Save Your Route**
   - Review the complete flow: Device → Pipeline → Target
   - Click **Save route** (blue button at bottom)
   - The route is now active and processing will begin

## Verify Your Route

After saving, you should see:
- **Solid connection line**: Between device and target (no longer dotted)
- **Pipeline rectangle**: Blue box on the connection line showing your pipeline name
- **Route status**: Active and ready to process data

## Test Your Data Flow

Let's verify everything is working:

### Send Test Data

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
logger -n <your-server-ip> -P 514 "Test: DataStream route verification $(date)"
```

**Windows (if you have a syslog client):**
```powershell
# Send test syslog message using your preferred tool
```

### Check for Processed Data

1. **Navigate to your target directory** (the location you specified in your File target)
2. **Look for JSON files** with today's date (format: `logs-2024_01_15.json`)
3. **Open the file** to verify it contains processed data

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "message": "Test: DataStream route verification Mon Jan 15 10:30:00 2024",
  "host": {"name": "your-server"},
  "log": {"level": "info"},
  "event": {"category": ["network"]}
}
```

### Monitor Processing

1. **Check Director Status**:
   - Go to **Fleet Management** → **Directors**
   - Verify "Connected" status
   - Review **Activity Logs** for processing messages

2. **Review Route Performance**:
   - Return to **Quick Routes**
   - Click on your route's blue rectangle
   - Look for processing statistics or error indicators

## Advanced Route Features

Once your basic route is working, you can explore additional features:

### Add More Pipelines

- Click the **+** button in the middle of your connection line
- Search for and select additional pipelines
- Create processing chains for complex transformations

### Edit Route Configuration

- Click on the route's blue rectangle
- Modify pipeline selections using **Change** or **Remove** options
- Save changes to update the active route

### Route Filtering

For more advanced routing with conditional logic:
- Go to **Routes** → **Advanced Routes**
- Create routes with filtering expressions
- Direct specific data types to different targets

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

**Route not processing data?**

1. **Verify all components are enabled**:
   - Device status: Enabled
   - Target status: Enabled  
   - Director status: Connected

2. **Check network connectivity**:
   - Port 514 open for syslog input
   - Firewall allows traffic to your device
   - Target directory exists and is writable

3. **Review processing logs**:
   - Director Activity Logs for error messages
   - Device connection status
   - Pipeline processing errors

**Data format issues?**
- Verify you selected the correct pipeline template
- Check that your syslog format matches the pipeline expectations
- Consider customizing the pipeline for your specific log structure
