# Getting Started: Overview

Welcome to **VirtualMetric DataStream**. This section will help you deploy your product and get started using it.

Here are the steps to get started:

1. Before you proceed, please review our [**Deployment Models**](../deployment/index.mdx#models) first to see your options.

    To deploy **on cloud**, see the relevant sections for **Azure** in the same chapter.

    Here, we will deploy **on premises** as server&mdash;for **Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Copilot+** (ARM64).

3. Once you have picked your deployment model and the location that suit you, use the relevant sections to install the required binaries and make the basic settings.

    Here, we will use [**Single Node Deployment**](./single-node.mdx)&mdash;i.e. we will deploy on a single machine as this is simplest and most straightforward.

4. After completing your deployment, review [**Configuration Basics**](./configuration-basics.mdx) to get a glimpse of how you will use **Director**.

5. Once you have seen how to configure your _YAML_ files and invoke them from **Director**, you can proceed to the following **Examples** to exercise what you have learned:

    - [**Example: Ingesting Data** - Configure your first device to receive streaming data](./example-ingesting-data.mdx)

    - [**Example: Forwarding Data** - Configure your first target to send streaming data](./example-forwarding-data.mdx)

    - [**Example: Routing Data** - Learn how to combine devices to targets, and use pipelines to process the routed data](./example-routing-data.mdx)

    - [**Example: A Syslog-To-Sentinel Pipeline** - A full, end-to-end pipeline in action](./example-a-syslog-to-sentinel-pipeline.mdx)
