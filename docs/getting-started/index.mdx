# Getting Started: Overview

Welcome to your first installation of **VirtualMetric DataStream**. This section will help you deploy your product and get started using it.

You have various deployment options:

* **On Premises**: Server (for Windows, Linux, etc.), Copilot+ PC (ARM64), macOS

* **On Cloud**: Azure Apps, Azure Functions, Azure VMs

Once you have picked the one that suits your needs, you can use the following chapters in this section for your deployment:

* **Single Node Deployment**: deploying on a [single machine](/docs/getting-started/single-node-deployment.mdx)

* **Cluster Deployment**: deploying on [multiple machines](/docs/getting-started/cluster-deployment.mdx) (including the cloud)

After completing your deployment, review the [Basics](/docs/getting-started/basics.mdx) section to get a glimpse of the various items you will use with **Director** to configure and run pipelines. Then, you can see **Director** in action by trying the following introductory examples in the indicated order:

1. [Example: Ingesting Data](/docs/getting-started/example-device.mdx)

2. [Example: Forwarding Data](/docs/getting-started/example-target.mdx)

3. [Example: Routing Data](/docs/getting-started/example-route.mdx)
