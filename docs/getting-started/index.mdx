# Getting Started: Overview

Welcome to **VirtualMetric DataStream**. This section will help you deploy your product and get started using it.

1. Before you proceed, please review our [**Deployment Models**](../deployment/index.mdx#models) first to see your options.

2. To deploy **on cloud**, see the relevant sections for **Azure** under the **Deployment** chapter.

    Here, we will deploy **on premises** as server&mdash;for **Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Copilot+** (ARM64).

3. Once you have picked your deployment model and the location that suit you, use the relevant sections to install the required binaries and make the basic settings.

    :::warning[important]
    Do _not_ proceed without completing the deployment procedure for **Director** to execute properly.
    :::

    Here, we will use [**Single Node Deployment**](./single-node.mdx), i.e. we will deploy on a single machine.

4. After completing your deployment, review [**Configuration Basics**](./configuration-basics.mdx) to get a glimpse of how you will use **Director**.

5. Once you have seen how to configure your _YAML_ files and invoke them from **Director**, you can proceed to the **Examples** to exercise what you have learned.
