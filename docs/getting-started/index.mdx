# Getting Started: Overview

Welcome to **VirtualMetric DataStream**. This section will help you deploy your product and get started using it.

1. Before you proceed, please review our [**Deployment Models**](../deployment/index.mdx#models) first to see your options.

2. To deploy **on cloud**, see the relevant sections for **Azure** under the **Deployment** chapter.

    Here, we will deploy **on premises**: i.e. as server (for Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.), and Copilot+ PC (ARM64).

3. Once you have picked your deployment model and the location that suit you, use the relevant sections to install the required binaries and make the basic settings.

    Here, we will use [**Single Node Deployment**](./single-node.mdx), i.e. we will deploy on a single machine.

    :::warning[important]
    Do _not_ proceed before completing the deployment procedure which involves setting up some environment variables for **Director** to run.

4. After completing your deployment, review [**Configuration Basics**](./configuration-basics.mdx) to get a glimpse of how you will use **Director**.

5. Once you have learned how to configure **Director**, you can proceed to the **Examples** to exercise what you have learned.
