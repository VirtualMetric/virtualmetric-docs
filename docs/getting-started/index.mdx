# Getting Started: Overview

Welcome to your first installation of **VirtualMetric DataStream**. In this section, you will find the required procedures for:

* **Single Node Deployment**: deploying on a [single machine](/docs/getting-started/single-node-deployment.mdx)

* **Cluster Deployment**: deploying on [multiple machines](/docs/getting-started/cluster-deployment.mdx) (including the cloud)

Once you completed your deployment, you can see **Director** in action right away by trying the following preliminary examples in the indicated order:

1. [Example: Ingest Data From Syslog](/docs/getting-started/example-device.mdx)

2. [Example: Send Data To Sentinel](/docs/getting-started/example-target.mdx)

3. [Example: Basic Routing](/docs/getting-started/example-route.mdx)

4. [Example: A Syslog-To-Sentinel Pipeline](/docs/getting-started/example-pipeline.mdx)
