# Getting Started: Overview

Welcome to your first installation of **VirtualMetric DataStream**. This section will help you deploy your product and get started using it.

For deployment, you have these options:

* **On Premises**: Server (for Windows, Linux, etc.), Copilot+ PC (ARM64), macOS

* **On Cloud**: Azure Apps, Azure Functions, Azure VMs

Once you have picked the one that suits you, you can use the following sections to install the required binaries and make the basic settings:

* **Single Node Deployment**: deploying on a [single machine](../deployment/single-node.mdx)

* **Cluster Deployment**: deploying on [multiple machines](../deployment/cluster.mdx) (including the cloud)

After completing your deployment, review [Configuration Basics](./configuration-basics.mdx) to get a glimpse of how you will use **Director**.
