# Getting Started: Overview

Welcome to **VirtualMetric DataStream**. This section will help you deploy your product and get started using it.

Here are the steps to get started:

1. Before you proceed, please review our [**Deployment Models**](./deployment/index.mdx#models) to see your options.

    To deploy **locally**, see the [**On Local**](./deployment/on-local.mdx) section in the **Deployment** chapter.

    To deploy **on cloud**, see the relevant sections for **Azure** in the same chapter.

    Here, we will deploy **on premises** as server&mdash;for **Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Copilot+** (ARM64).

3. Once you have picked your deployment model and the location that suits you, use the relevant sections to install the binaries and make the required settings.

    To deploy as clusters, see the [**As Cluster**](./deployment/as-cluster.mdx) section in the same chapter.

    Here, we will use [**Single Node Deployment**](./single-node-deployment.mdx)&mdash;i.e. we will deploy on a single machine as this is simplest and most straightforward.

4. After completing your deployment, review [**Configuration Basics**](./configuration-basics.mdx) to get a glimpse of how you will use **Director**.

5. As soon as you learn how to configure YAML files as **Director** expects them, and invoke the processes these files spawn from the **CLI**, you can proceed to the following **Examples** to exercise what you have learned:

    - [**Example: Ingesting Data**](./example-ingesting-data.mdx) - Configure your first device to receive streaming data

    - [**Example: Forwarding Data**](./example-forwarding-data.mdx) - Configure your first target to send streaming data

    - [**Example: A Syslog-To-Parquet Pipeline**](./example-a-syslog-to-parquet-pipeline.mdx) - A full, end-to-end pipeline in action

    - [**Example: Using Agents**](./example-using-agents.mdx) - Configure your first **Agent** for unattended execution
