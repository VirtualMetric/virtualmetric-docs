# Getting Started: Configuration Basics

The purpose of this section is to introduce you to **VirtualMetric Director**'s configuration logic, and to provide a basic understanding of how it works.

## The Components

**Director** uses the following types of configurable components to collect data points, to process them, and to forward them to destinations:

* **Devices** - Data sources that collect or receive data. For a detailed discussion, see [Devices: Overview](../configuration/devices/index.mdx#configuration).

* **Targets** - Destinations where processed data is sent. For a detailed discussion, see [Targets: overview](../configuration/targets/index.mdx#configuration).

* **Pipelines** - String of processors that transform the data. For a detailed discussion, see [Pipelines: Overview](../configuration/pipelines/index.mdx#configuration).

* **Routes** - Predefined data flows from devices through pipelines to targets. For a detailed discussion, see [Routes: Overview](../configuration/routes.mdx#configuration).

The examples cover the basic forms of each of these components.

## The Configuration Files

To configure the above-mentioned components for telemetry streams, we use YAML files.

:::tip
To learn where these files are placed and how they can be arranged, review [**this section**](../configuration/index.mdx#managing-yaml-files).
:::

To illustrate, in order to stream data in _Syslog_ format and send it to the console, the  configuration YAML&mdash;which should be placed somewhere under the `config` directory under `<vm_root>`&mdash;should contain at least these settings:

```yaml title="simple-route.yml"
devices:
  - id: 1
    name: from_syslog
    type: syslog

targets:
  - name: to_console
    type: console

routes:
  - name: simple_route
    devices:
      - name: from_syslog
    targets:
      - name: to_console
```

**Director** reads iterates the directory tree under `config`, scanning each `*.yml` file to spot the route you want to run&mdash;here `simple_route`.

:::note
**Director** does _not_ care about the filenames you use. That is only for your convenience, to organize your components as you site. It only cares about the identifiers you use for them, i.e. the `id` value for devices and the `name` value for the others.
:::

The examples provide the basic configurations required for some of the most frequently used processes.

## The CLI

The configured components can be run by invoking **Director** from the terminal. For a detailed description of the command line functionality, see [**Appendix**](../appendix.mdx#cli).

:::tip
For convenience, you may want to add **VirtualMetric**'s root folder to your `$PATH` environment variable.
:::

Running configurations&mdash;for example the route named `simple_route` we have configured above&mdash;involves invoking VirtualMetric Director from the command line like so:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
    ```powershell
    vmetric-director -mode=route -name=simple_route
    ```
  </TabItem>    
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    ```bash
    vmetric-director -mode=route -name=simple_route
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
    ```bash
    vmetric-director -mode=route -name=simple_route
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The examples provide the relevant commands required to run them.

## Working Directory

For our purposes, and to keep things simple, we will be using the following folder as our working directory, and we will place all our files directly under it:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
    ```powershell
    C:\path\to\<vm_root>\config\Examples
    ```
  </TabItem>    
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    ```bash
    /usr/bin/path/to/<vm_root>/config/Examples
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
    ```bash
    /Applications/path/to/<vm_root>/config/Examples
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We will be saving all our configuration files in this directory. We will also specify our output files to be created here.

## Logging Setup

Finally, a simple configuration for logging is in order for you to be able to check your results.

* Go to `<vm_root>` (i.e. the folder where you have placed **VirtualMetric**)
* Find the `config` directory, which is directly under `<vm_root>`
* Open the file named `vmetric.yml`
* Add the following lines to it:

  ```yaml
  debug:
    log:
      status: true
    level: 4
    console:
      status: true
  ```

**Director** will generate the logs of your runs and place them under the following folder:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
    ```powershell
    C:\path\to\<vm_root>\storage\logs
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    ```bash
    /usr/bin/path/to/<vm_root>/storage/logs
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
    ```bash
    /Applications/path/to/<vm_root>/storage/logs
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now you are ready to see **Director** in action. First, we will see how to ingest data using a _device_.
