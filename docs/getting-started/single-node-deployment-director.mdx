# Single Node Deployment: Director

To download, install, and test run the **VirtualMetric Director** binary, follow the instructions below.

## System Requirements

**VirtualMetric** applications support the `amd64` and `arm64` versions of **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**. Their minimum requirements are:

- **CPU**: **1 core** - We recommend using a machine with at least **2 CPU cores**. As our system uses a _vectorized pipeline_ and can utilize all available cores, having multiple cores will improve performance
- **Memory**: **150MB** - Depending on the volumes you need to handle, more memory will improve performance
- **Disk**: **250MB** - Depending on the amount of temporary data you need storage, more disk space will improve performance

  If you need to retain logs for extended periods or minimize potential data loss in case of unexpected failures, consider allocating additional disk space accordingly.

---

**Director** is a single binary that requires no dependencies, so you can easily download and place it anywhere on your system. It can be installed on a traditional server, on an on-premises virtual machine, or in the cloud. It can also be deployed as an [**Azure App**](../deployment/on-azure-app-service.mdx) for a serverless configuration.

### Installation

You can install **Director** online or offline, depending on your system's internet access.

:::warning[attention]
**Director**  does _not_ require administrative privileges to run as a background process. However, if you want to run it as a _service_, administrative privileges are required for installing, starting, or stopping it.

Once installed, you can run **Director** as a service with regular user privileges.
:::

This guide assumes you are installing **Director** as a _service_. If you do not have the necessary privileges to run it as a service, you can configure **Director** to run as a **Scheduled Task** (on Windows) or a **Cron job** (on Linux/macOS) to ensure it starts automatically after a reboot.

#### Online

If your system has internet access, you can use our automated installation scripts for a quick setup.

:::note
The `dl.vget.me` file contains our official installation script that performs the steps listed below.
:::

<Tabs groupId="cli-options">
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>  
    To run as a background process:

    ```PowerShell
    iwr dl.vget.me | iex
    ```

    To install as a service:

    ```PowerShell
    $p="C:\Program Files\VirtualMetric"; iwr dl.vget.me | iex
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">  
    To run as a background process:

    ```bash
    curl -sL dl.vget.me | bash
    ```

    To install as a service:

    ```bash
    curl -sL dl.vget.me | p="/opt/virtualmetric" bash
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The script will

- detect your operating system and architecture
- download the appropriate version
- install and configure the binary based on your selected method (service or background process)
- launch the executable

#### Offline

For systems without internet access, you can download and install **Director** manually. Choose the appropriate binary for your system from the table below:

<table style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
  <tr><th>Operating System</th><th>Download Link</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Windows</td>
   <td><a href="https://dl.vget.me/director/windows/amd64/vmetric-director.exe">**Director** for AMD64</a></td>
   </tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://dl.vget.me/director/windows/arm64/vmetric-director.exe">**Director** for ARM64</a></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Linux</td>
    <td><a href="https://dl.vget.me/director/linux/amd64/vmetric-director">**Director** for AMD64</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://dl.vget.me/director/linux/arm64/vmetric-director">**Director** for ARM64</a></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">macOS</td>
    <td><a href="https://dl.vget.me/director/darwin/amd64/vmetric-director">**Director** for AMD64</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://dl.vget.me/director/darwin/arm64/vmetric-director">**Director** for ARM64</a></td></tr>
</table>

Once you have downloaded the binary, open a terminal with admin privileges. Create the directory where you want to run **Director** if you haven't [already done so](./introduction.mdx#deployment), and copy the downloaded binary to it. Then, navigate to that directory.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
    ```PowerShell
    Copy-Item -Path C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\vmetric-director.exe -Destination "C:\Program Files\VirtualMetric"
    Set-Location "C:\Program Files\VirtualMetric"
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    On **Linux**:

    ```bash
    mkdir /opt/virtualmetric
    cp ./vmetric-director /opt/virtualmetric
    cd /opt/virtualmetric
    ```

    On **macOS**:

    ```bash
    mkdir /Applications/VirtualMetric
    cp ./vmetric-director /Applications/VirtualMetric
    cd /Applications/VirtualMetric
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you don't have enough privileges to start the service, you can run **Director** as a background process:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
    ```PowerShell
    .\vmetric-director -background
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    ```bash
    ./vmetric-director -background
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you _do_ have the required privileges, you can start **Director** as a service by running the following commands:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
    ```PowerShell
    .\vmetric-director -service install
    .\vmetric-director -service start
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    ```bash
    ./vmetric-director -service install
    ./vmetric-director -service start
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Post-Installation

After completing the above steps, if you have installed **Director** as a service, you can verify its status by using the following command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
    ```PowerShell
    Get-Service vmetric-director

    Status   Name               DisplayName
    ------   ----               -----------
    Running  vmetric-director   VirtualMetric Director
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    ```bash
    systemctl status vmetric-director
    TODO: Complete
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To stop the service, use:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
    ```PowerShell
    .\vmetric-director -service stop
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    ```bash
    ./vmetric-director -service stop
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
