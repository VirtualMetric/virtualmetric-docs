# Directors: Management

The **Directors** web interface provides comprehensive management capabilities for Director deployment, configuration, and monitoring through an intuitive graphical dashboard.

## Accessing Directors Dashboard

Navigate to the Directors management interface:

- Go to **Home** > **Fleet Management** > **Directors**

-or-

- Click the hamburger menu on the top left
- Select **Fleet Management** > **Directors**

## Directors Overview

The Directors dashboard provides centralized visibility and control over all Director instances across your infrastructure. Directors orchestrate data collection, processing, and routing, with support for distributed processing through Agent pre-processing capabilities.

### Directors Table

The main table displays all configured Directors with the following columns:

- **Name** - Unique identifier assigned during Director creation
- **Mode** - Management type (Managed or Self-Managed)
- **Installation Type** - Architecture (Standalone or Cluster)
- **Status** - Operational state (Enabled or Disabled)
- **Connection Status** - Real-time connectivity (Connected or Not Connected)
- **Actions Menu (⋮)** - Per-Director operations

### Configuration Change Indicator

For **Self-Managed** Directors, a warning icon appears next to the Mode when configuration has changed:

- **Warning Icon** - Orange/yellow alert indicator
- **Tooltip** - "Configuration has changed and the current one has to be deployed"
- **Action Required** - Download updated configuration file and deploy to Director

:::warning
When the configuration change indicator appears, the Director is running with an outdated configuration. Download and deploy the updated `vmetric.vmf` file promptly to ensure consistent behavior.

- **Agents** - List of agents connected to this Director
- **Action Required** - Remove or reassign dependencies before deletion

**Dependency Resolution:**
1. Note listed devices and agents
2. Reassign devices to different Director or delete
3. Reassign agents to different Director or delete
4. Retry Director deletion after dependencies removed

## Agent Pre-Processing Management

Directors can configure Agents to perform pipeline-based pre-processing of logs before transmission. This distributed processing model reduces Director workload and enables edge-based data transformation.

### Pre-Processing Architecture

**Processing Flow with Agent Pre-Processing:**

1. **Agent Collection** - Agent collects logs locally at endpoint
2. **Agent Processing** - Agent executes configured pipeline transformations
3. **Agent Transmission** - Agent sends pre-processed data to Director
4. **Director Routing** - Director forwards data to targets (optional additional processing)

**Processing Flow without Agent Pre-Processing:**

1. **Agent Collection** - Agent collects logs locally at endpoint
2. **Agent Transmission** - Agent sends raw data to Director
3. **Director Processing** - Director executes pipeline transformations
4. **Director Routing** - Director forwards processed data to targets

### Configuring Agent Pre-Processing

Agent pre-processing is configured through device settings in the Director interface:

**Configuration Location:**
- Navigate to **Home** > **Fleet Management** > **Devices**
- Select the Agent device to configure
- Assign pipeline to device configuration
- Pipeline executes on Agent before data transmission

**Pipeline Assignment:**
- Same pipeline syntax as Director pipelines
- All processor types available for Agent execution
- Configuration managed centrally through Director
- Changes synchronized automatically to Agents

### Pre-Processing Use Cases

**High-Volume Log Filtering:**
- Filter non-essential logs at collection point
- Reduce network bandwidth consumption
- Distribute processing load across Agents
- Improve Director scalability

**Edge-Based Compliance:**
- Mask sensitive data (PII, credentials) at source
- Apply regulatory transformations before transmission
- Ensure compliance before data leaves endpoint
- Support data sovereignty requirements

**Distributed Processing:**
- Process data locally in remote offices
- Minimize central Director processing load
- Support intermittent connectivity scenarios
- Optimize infrastructure costs

### Configuration Best Practices

**Pipeline Design:**
- Use Agent pre-processing for filtering and basic transformations
- Reserve complex processing (enrichment, external lookups) for Director
- Balance processing load between Agents and Directors
- Monitor Agent resource utilization

:::tip
Agents are ideal for data reduction tasks (filtering, sampling, field removal) while Directors handle enrichment operations that require external resources like GeoIP databases or threat intelligence feeds.
:::

**Performance Optimization:**
- Assign lightweight pipelines to resource-constrained Agents
- Use Director processing for computationally intensive operations
- Test pipeline performance on Agent hardware before deployment
- Monitor Agent CPU and memory usage

**Operational Management:**
- Configure pipelines centrally through Director interface
- Use hot configuration reload to update Agent pipelines
- Monitor Agent processing metrics through Director dashboard
- Maintain pipeline version consistency across Agents

## Notifications

## Director Management Best Practices

### Configuration Management

**Self-Managed Directors:**
- Monitor configuration change indicators regularly
- Download and deploy config updates promptly
- Test configuration changes in non-production first
- Maintain configuration version history
- Review Agent pre-processing configurations when updating Director pipelines

**Managed Directors:**
- VirtualMetric handles configuration updates automatically
- Monitor activity logs for automated changes
- Review notifications for update confirmations

### Status Monitoring

**Connection Status:**
- Regularly verify "Connected" status in overview table
- Investigate "Not Connected" status immediately
- Check Activity Logs for connection event history
- Review Director logs for connectivity issues

**Operational Status:**
- Keep Directors "Enabled" for active data processing
- Use "Disabled" status for maintenance windows
- Document reason for status changes in external systems
- Monitor activity logs for unexpected status changes

### Lifecycle Management

**Creation:**
- Use descriptive, meaningful Director names
- Select appropriate Mode for operational requirements
- Verify connection before completing setup
- Document Director purpose and deployment details

**Maintenance:**
- Review Activity Logs periodically
- Keep Directors updated with latest configurations
- Monitor connection status for reliability
- Test configuration changes before deployment

**Deletion:**
- Verify no active dependencies before deletion
- Document reason for Director removal
- Archive Activity Logs for compliance
- Reassign workloads to remaining Directors
