# Directors: Management

The **Directors** web interface provides comprehensive management capabilities for Director deployment, configuration, and monitoring through an intuitive graphical dashboard.

## Access

Navigate to **Home** > **Fleet Management** > **Directors**, or use the hamburger menu and select **Fleet Management** > **Directors**.

## Overview

The Directors dashboard provides centralized visibility and control over all Director instances across your infrastructure. Directors orchestrate data collection, processing, and routing, with support for distributed processing through Agent pre-processing capabilities.

### Table

The table displays **Name**, **Mode** (Managed/Self-Managed), **Installation Type** (Standalone/Cluster), **Status** (Enabled/Disabled), **Connection Status** (Connected/Not Connected), and an **Actions menu** (⋮) for each Director.

For **Self-Managed** Directors, a warning icon appears next to the Mode when configuration has changed. The tooltip reads "Configuration has changed and the current one has to be deployed" - download the updated configuration file and deploy to Director.

:::warning
When the configuration change indicator appears, the Director is running with an outdated configuration. Download and deploy the updated `vmetric.vmf` file promptly to ensure consistent behavior.
:::

### Table Controls

Filter Directors using **Search directors** (by name) and **Status** dropdown (All, Enabled, Disabled). The <gui>Refresh</gui> button reloads table data. Click <gui>Create director</gui> to launch the creation wizard (requires DIRECTOR_CREATE permission).

### Actions

Each Director row provides an **Actions menu** (⋮) with the following operations:

**View Details:**
- <gui>See details</gui> - Navigate to Director detail view

**Status Management:**
- <gui>Enable Director</gui> - Activate disabled Director

If Director has active dependencies, error modal displays:

:::note
Directors with connected devices or agents cannot be deleted. The error modal lists all dependencies that must be reassigned or removed first.
:::

**Error Modal Contents:**
- "Cannot delete Director" message
- **Devices** - List of devices using this Director
- **Agents** - List of agents connected to this Director
- **Action Required** - Remove or reassign dependencies before deletion

**Dependency Resolution:**
1. Note listed devices and agents
2. Reassign devices to different Director or delete
3. Reassign agents to different Director or delete
4. Retry Director deletion after dependencies removed

## Agent Pre-Processing

Directors can configure Agents to perform pipeline-based pre-processing of logs before transmission. This distributed processing model reduces Director workload, decreases network bandwidth consumption, and enables edge-based data transformation such as compliance masking.

:::info
For complete Agent documentation including deployment, management, pipeline assignment, and troubleshooting, see <Topic id="devices-agents">Devices: Agents</Topic>.
:::

## Notifications

The Directors interface provides automatic notifications for all operations:

### Success

Success messages auto-dismiss after 10 seconds. These include confirmations for Director creation (connected or pending), enabling, disabling, and deletion. Hover to pause the auto-close timer, or click X to dismiss manually.

### Errors

Error notifications persist until manually dismissed. These include failures for enable, disable, delete operations, and configuration download errors. Review error details and take corrective action before dismissing.

## Clusters

Clusters group multiple Directors together for high availability. When one Director fails, the remaining Directors automatically take over its workload. <Topic id="devices-agents">Agents</Topic> and Devices connect to the cluster as a whole, ensuring continuous operation as long as at least one Director remains healthy.

:::warning[Permanent Assignment]
Once a Director is added to a cluster, it cannot be individually modified, updated, or removed. All configuration changes must be made at the cluster level. The only way to release a Director from a cluster is to delete the entire cluster, after which the Director returns to standalone status.
:::
