# Directors: Management

The **Directors** web interface provides comprehensive management capabilities for Director deployment, configuration, and monitoring through an intuitive graphical dashboard.

## Access

Navigate to **Home** > **Fleet Management** > **Directors**, or use the hamburger menu and select **Fleet Management** > **Directors**.

## Overview

The Directors dashboard provides centralized visibility and control over all Director instances across your infrastructure. Directors orchestrate data collection, processing, and routing, with support for distributed processing through Agent pre-processing capabilities.

### Table

The table displays **Name**, **Mode** (Managed/Self-Managed), **Installation Type** (Standalone/Cluster), **Status** (Enabled/Disabled), **Connection Status** (Connected/Not Connected), and an **Actions menu** (⋮) for each Director.

For **Self-Managed** Directors, a warning icon appears next to the Mode when configuration has changed. The tooltip reads "Configuration has changed and the current one has to be deployed" - download the updated configuration file and deploy to Director.

:::warning
When the configuration change indicator appears, the Director is running with an outdated configuration. Download and deploy the updated `vmetric.vmf` file promptly to ensure consistent behavior.
:::

### Table Controls

Filter Directors using **Search directors** (by name) and **Status** dropdown (All, Enabled, Disabled). The <gui>Refresh</gui> button reloads table data. Click <gui>Create director</gui> to launch the creation wizard (requires DIRECTOR_CREATE permission).

### Actions

Each Director row provides an **Actions menu** (⋮) with the following operations:

**View Details:**
- <gui>See details</gui> - Navigate to Director detail view

**Configuration Update Workflow:**

When configuration changes occur:
- Warning icon appears next to "Self-managed" mode indicator
- Tooltip indicates deployment needed
- Download updated config file
- Replace existing config on Director server
- Restart Director service to apply changes

:::warning
Self-Managed Directors require a service restart after deploying configuration updates. Plan maintenance windows accordingly for production environments.
:::

### Delete

**Delete Director Process:**

Remove a Director from the platform with dependency checking:

1. Navigate to Director detail view (or use Actions menu from overview)
2. Click **Actions** menu
3. Select <gui>Delete Director</gui>
4. Deletion modal appears with confirmation

**Standard Deletion:**
- Confirm Director name matches
- Click <gui>Delete</gui> to proceed
- Success notification confirms deletion
- Redirect to Directors overview

**Deletion with Dependencies:**

If Director has active dependencies, error modal displays:

:::note
Directors with connected devices or agents cannot be deleted. The error modal lists all dependencies that must be reassigned or removed first.
:::

**Error Modal Contents:**
- "Cannot delete Director" message
- **Devices** - List of devices using this Director
- **Agents** - List of agents connected to this Director
- **Action Required** - Remove or reassign dependencies before deletion

**Dependency Resolution:**
1. Note listed devices and agents
2. Reassign devices to different Director or delete
3. Reassign agents to different Director or delete
4. Retry Director deletion after dependencies removed

## Agent Pre-Processing Management

Directors can configure Agents to perform pipeline-based pre-processing of logs before transmission. This distributed processing model reduces Director workload and enables edge-based data transformation.

### Architecture

**Processing Flow with Agent Pre-Processing:**

1. **Agent Collection** - Agent collects logs locally at endpoint
2. **Agent Processing** - Agent executes configured pipeline transformations
3. **Agent Transmission** - Agent sends pre-processed data to Director
4. **Director Routing** - Director forwards data to targets (optional additional processing)

**Processing Flow without Agent Pre-Processing:**

1. **Agent Collection** - Agent collects logs locally at endpoint
2. **Agent Transmission** - Agent sends raw data to Director
3. **Director Processing** - Director executes pipeline transformations
4. **Director Routing** - Director forwards processed data to targets

### Configuration

Agent pre-processing is configured through device settings in the Director interface:

**Configuration Location:**
- Navigate to **Home** > **Fleet Management** > **Devices**
- Select the Agent device to configure
- Assign pipeline to device configuration
- Pipeline executes on Agent before data transmission

**Pipeline Assignment:**
- Same pipeline syntax as Director pipelines
- All processor types available for Agent execution
- Configuration managed centrally through Director
- Changes synchronized automatically to Agents

### Pre-Processing Use Cases

**High-Volume Log Filtering:**
- Filter non-essential logs at collection point
- Reduce network bandwidth consumption
- Distribute processing load across Agents
- Improve Director scalability

**Edge-Based Compliance:**
- Mask sensitive data (PII, credentials) at source
- Apply regulatory transformations before transmission
- Ensure compliance before data leaves endpoint
- Support data sovereignty requirements

**Distributed Processing:**
- Process data locally in remote offices
- Minimize central Director processing load
- Support intermittent connectivity scenarios
- Optimize infrastructure costs

### Pipeline Distribution

Distribute processing between Agents and Directors based on operation type:

| Operation Type | Execute On | Reason |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| Filtering, sampling, field removal | Agent | Reduces network bandwidth |
| GeoIP lookups, threat intelligence | Director | Requires external resources |
| Lightweight transformations | Agent | Edge processing efficiency |
| Computationally intensive operations | Director | Better resource availability |

:::tip
Configure pipelines centrally through the Director interface. Changes synchronize automatically to Agents via hot configuration reload.

## Notifications

The Directors interface provides automatic notifications for all operations:

### Success Notifications

Success messages auto-dismiss after 10 seconds. These include confirmations for Director creation (connected or pending), enabling, disabling, and deletion. Hover to pause the auto-close timer, or click X to dismiss manually.

### Error Notifications

Error notifications persist until manually dismissed. These include failures for enable, disable, delete operations, and configuration download errors. Review error details and take corrective action before dismissing.
