# Routes: Management

Managing routes effectively is crucial for maintaining an effective and efficient data flow in your environment. This guide covers the key aspects of route administration and management.

## Creation

Routes can be created through configuration files or the management interface.

They can then be modified in several ways:

* **editing** - update route parameters, modify conditions, change the pipeline assignments, and adjust target configurations
* **moving** - change the routes' order, adjust their processing priorities, and optimize the data flow
* **copying** - duplicate existing routes, modify them for other purposes, and ensure that the configurations are consistent

Once their work is done, routes can be safely removed: just mark them for deletion. (Optionally, they can be disabled first.)

## Groups

Routes can be grouped by **function**, i.e. for what purpose they are used, or by **source**, i.e. where they get their data from.

## Priority

Routes are evaluated in order based on their priority such that more specific routes come first, followed by critical processing routes, then by general purpose routes, and finally by catch-all ones.

## Health

For route performance and health checks, it is a good practice to track key metrics like route conditions, event throughput, processing time, pipeline connectivity and efficiency, target accessibility and availability, resource usage, and error rates.

Route performance can be optimized by attending the following:

* **conditions** - use effective and efficient filters, minimize complex conditions, remove redundant checks
* **pipelines** - reduce unnecessary processing, streamline transformation logic, and monitor resource usage
* **targets** - balance load across targets, monitor their health, and optimize batch sizes

Also, routes can be managed in _clustered_ environments:

* **configuration syncing** - Maintain consistent configurations, synchronize route updates, and handle failover scenarios
* **load distribution** - Balance processing across nodes, monitor cluster health, and handle node failures

## Versioning

Route versions can be maintained using:

* **change management** - tracking changes, maintaining version history, and documenting modifications
* **backup and recovery** - regular backups, rcovery procedures, and rollback capability

## Monitoring

Following some guidelines will prove to be useful in managing routes:

* **documentation** - document the purpose, and record the dependencies
* **testing** - test new configurations, verify the data flow, and validate the results
* **maintenance** - make regular reviews, optimize performance, and apply updates

For security purposes, the following should be kept in mind:

* **access control** - manage user permissions, control configuration changes, and audit modifications
* **data protection** - secure sensitive data, encrypt communications, and monitor access patterns

## Troubleshooting

The most common issues are:

* **route not matching** - verify the conditions, check the data format, and review the route order
* **pipeline failures** - check the processor configurations, verify the dependencies, and monitor resource usage
* **target connectivity** - verify network access, check the credentials, and monitor target health

For resolving the issues, enable debug logging, review the error messages, check the configuration syntax, verify the dependencies, and always test modified routes.

## Best Practices

As usual, a number of guidelines are in order when designing, using, and maintaining routes:

Use clear, descriptive names that bear the purpose, e.g. `apache_to_analytics`, and keep them consistent across similar routes.

When filtering, start with the most specific routes, and use precise and effective conditions, avoiding overlapping ones.

When assigning, use a single pipeline whenever possible. Document multi-pipeline routes as their intricacies may yield unexpected results. Duplicate data only if it is absolutely necessary.

Collate similar targets, documenting any mirroring requirements, and consider the target capacity and throughput.
