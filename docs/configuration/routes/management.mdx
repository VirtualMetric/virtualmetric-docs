# Routes: Management

The **Routes** web interface provides comprehensive management for data flow orchestration through two distinct approaches: Quick Routes for simple configurations and Advanced Routes for complex routing logic.

## Access

Navigate to **Home** > **Routes**, or use the hamburger menu and select **Routes**.

## Overview

The Routes interface is where you orchestrate data flow from devices through pipelines to targets. Routes act as traffic controllers, determining what data goes through which processing pipelines and reaches which destinations.

**DataStream** provides two route types:

| Aspect | Quick Routes | Advanced Routes |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Interface | Visual drag-and-drop | Multi-step wizard |
| Complexity | Simple device-to-target | Complex filtering, conditional logic |
| Directors | All Directors | Selectable Directors |
| Scheduling | Continuous only | Cron or interval scheduling |
| Best for | Straightforward data flows | Enterprise routing scenarios |

## Quick Routes

Quick Routes provides a visual interface for creating simple data flows with drag-and-drop functionality.

### Interface

The Quick Routes page displays a flow diagram showing connections between devices and targets.

**Interface Components:**

**Left Panel - Devices:**
- Device type boxes showing configured devices
- Each box displays device icon, name, and type
- Click **+** button to add device to flow
- Devices appear on the left side of the canvas

**Right Panel - Targets:**
- Target type boxes showing configured targets
- Each box displays target icon, name, and type
- Click **+** button to add target to flow
- Targets appear on the right side of the canvas

**Center Canvas - Flow Diagram:**
- Visual representation of data flows
- Connection lines between devices and targets
- Pipeline nodes on connection lines (optional)
- Direct connections or pipeline-mediated connections

### Creating

**Add Device to Flow:**
1. Locate device type in left panel
2. Click **+** button on device box
3. Drawer opens with device selection
4. Select device from list
5. Device appears on canvas

**Add Target to Flow:**
1. Locate target type in right panel
2. Click **+** button on target box
3. Drawer opens with target selection
4. Select target from list
5. Target appears on canvas

**Connect Device to Target:**

Connection happens automatically when both device and target are added to the canvas. The system creates a direct route connection.

**Add Pipeline to Connection:**
1. Click on connection line between device and target
2. **Select Pipeline** modal appears
3. Choose pipeline from dropdown list
4. Click **Select** to add pipeline to connection
5. Pipeline node appears on connection line
6. Data flows through: Device → Pipeline → Target

### Managing

**View Route Details:**
- Hover over connection line to see route name
- Click connection line to see route configuration
- Pipeline nodes show pipeline name

**Remove Pipeline from Route:**
1. Click on pipeline node on connection line
2. Connection reverts to direct device-to-target flow

**Delete Route:**
1. Click connection line
2. Modal appears with delete confirmation
3. Confirm to remove route
4. Connection line disappears from canvas

**Remove Device:**
1. Click device node on canvas
2. Delete modal appears
3. Confirm to remove device
4. All routes using this device are deleted

**Remove Target:**
1. Click target node on canvas
2. Delete modal appears
3. Confirm to remove target
4. All routes using this target are deleted

## Advanced Routes

Advanced Routes provides a wizard-based interface for creating complex routing configurations with filtering, director selection, and scheduling.

### List

The Advanced Routes page displays a table of all configured advanced routes.

The table displays **Name**, **Status** (Active/Passive), **Director** assignments, **Pipeline** name, **Default Target**, and an **Actions menu** (⋮) for each route.

Filter routes using **Search routes** (by name) and **Status** dropdown (All, Active, Passive). The **Refresh** button reloads table data. Click **Create advanced route** to launch the creation wizard.

### Actions

Each route row provides an **Actions menu** (⋮) with the following operations:

**View and Edit:**
- **Edit route** - Navigate to route edit interface
- **View details** - Navigate to route detail view

**Status Management:**
- **Activate Route** - Set route to Active status
- **Deactivate Route** - Set route to Passive status

**Deletion:**
- **Delete Route** - Remove route from platform

## Create Advanced Route Wizard

The advanced route creation process uses a multi-step wizard with comprehensive configuration.

### Details

Configure basic route information and connections.

**Route Information:**

**Name:**
- Unique route identifier
- Minimum 3 characters
- Maximum 50 characters

**Description:**
- Optional route explanation
- Character counter (max 100 characters)
- Describes route purpose

**Filter:**
- Optional filter expression
- Determines which events match this route
- Uses expression syntax for conditional matching
- Tooltip provides link to documentation
- Example: `event.type == "security" && event.severity > 3`

**Default Target:**
- Fallback destination for events that don't match specific targets
- Dropdown showing all configured targets
- Special "null" target option for dropping unmatched events
- Tooltip explains default target behavior

**Pipeline:**
- Required processing pipeline selection
- Dropdown showing all available pipelines
- Route processes all events through this pipeline

**Route Status:**
- Toggle between Active and Passive
- **Active**: Route processes events
- **Passive**: Route is configured but not processing

### Configuration

Configure device-to-target connections with optional filtering and pipeline routing.

**Route Configuration Interface:**

This step defines the specific data flow paths within the route.

**Device Selection:**
- Select which devices feed into this route
- Multiple devices can be selected
- Filter expressions can target specific devices

**Target Mapping:**
- Define which targets receive processed data
- Multiple targets can be configured
- Conditional target selection based on event content

**Processing Flow:**
- Device events enter route
- Route filter expression evaluated (from Step 1)
- Pipeline processes matching events (from Step 1)
- Events routed to appropriate targets
- Unmatched events go to default target

### Execution Settings

Configure route scheduling and execution behavior.

**Scheduling:**

Enable scheduling to run the route at specific times rather than continuous processing.

**Scheduling Toggle:**
- **Enable Scheduling** - Activate scheduled execution
- When disabled, route processes data continuously as it arrives
- When enabled, route accumulates data and processes on schedule

**Scheduling Method Selection:**

Choose between two scheduling approaches using radio tiles:
