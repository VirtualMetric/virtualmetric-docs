# Routes: Overview

Routes define how incoming data is filtered, processed, and directed to specific destinations. They act as traffic controllers, determining what data goes through which pipelines and ultimately reaches which targets.

## Definitions

Routes are made up of filtering expressions and sequences of processors that shape the format and flow of data streams. They curate data through an evaluation process and forward it to downstream consumers.

Their behavior is characterized by three key elements:

- **Devices** - One or more sources to ingest data from

- **Pipelines** - Optional processing schemes applied to selected events

- **Targets** - One or more destinations to forward the processed data

In addition to these, there is one more consideration that involves the binary relations between devices and pipelines, pipelines and targets, or directly devices and targets: the optional _filter expressions_ that match specific events.

## Configuration

All routes share the following base configuration fields:

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`name`|Y||Unique identifier for the route|
|`description`|N||Optional explanation of the route's purpose|
|`devices`|N||List of source IDs to collect events from|
|`if`|N||Expression determining if the route applies to an event|
|`pipelines`|N||Ordered list of pipelines to process matching events|
|`targets`|N||List of targets to deliver processed events to|
|`status`|N|`true`|Enable/disable the route|

:::warning
Do _not_ confuse field names like `pipelines` or `targets` with the component entries at the first level. As the highest level of a telemetry configuration, routes orchestrate the stream by specifying the components that constitute the traffic.
:::

:::note
Enlisted devices, targets, and pipelines must be configured in advance to be usable by routes. Use their ids or names to refer to them.
:::

**Example**:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: syslog_to_backup
    devices: 
      - name: syslog_*
    pipelines: 
      - name: normalize
      - name: enrich
    targets: 
      - name: backup
```

This route receives data from devices with the prefix `syslog_` in their names, transforms it using the `normalize` and `enrich` pipelines, and forwards it to the `backup` target.

## Deployment

Forwarding data involves several design patterns (use of pipelines is optional in each case):

* Single source to single target
  > Syslog → Route → [_Normalize_] → Storage

* Single source to multiple targets
  > Syslog → Route → [_Enrich_] → Monitoring + Storage + Backup

* Multiple sources to single target
  > Syslog + Apache → Route [_Normalize_] → Central Analytics

* Multiple sources to multiple targets
  > Syslog + Winlog + Apache → Route [_Normalize_ ∘ _Enrich_] → Cloud Upload + Central Analytics

Routes can include zero or more pipelines. Multiple pipelines will process data sequentially. A pipeline's processors can override routing using the `reroute` processor, and the `final` processor terminates execution.

## Route Types

Routes can be categorized based on their function in the data flow:

* **Primary Routes** - These routes handle critical data paths with high priority:
  * Specific filtering, targeted processing, and specialized destinations
  
* **Filtering Routes** - These routes select specific subsets of data:
  * Data segregation based on categories, security levels, or compliance requirements
  
* **Processing Routes** - These routes apply transformations to data:
  * Apply enrichment, normalization, or specialized processing
  
* **Distribution Routes** - These routes focus on delivering data to targets:
  * Fan-out delivery, redundant storage, or multi-system integration
  
* **Fallback Routes** - These routes catch any unmatched events:
  * Default processing for events that don't match specific criteria

## Use Cases

Some scenarios demonstrating the uses of routes:

* **Security Event Workflow**:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: security_critical
      if: "event.category == 'security' && event.severity == 'critical'"
      pipelines:
        - name: security_enrichment
        - name: threat_intelligence
      targets:
        - name: siem_platform
        - name: security_team_notification
    
    - name: security_standard
      if: "event.category == 'security'"
      pipelines:
        - name: security_enrichment
      targets:
        - name: security_elasticsearch
  ```

* **Data Segregation**:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: pci_data
      if: "tags.contains('pci')"
      pipelines:
        - name: pci_compliance
        - name: data_masking
      targets:
        - name: pci_storage
    
    - name: hipaa_data
      if: "tags.contains('hipaa')"
      pipelines:
        - name: hipaa_compliance
        - name: phi_protection
      targets:
        - name: hipaa_storage
  ```

* **Environment Separation**:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: production_logs
      if: "kubernetes.namespace == 'production'"
      pipelines:
        - name: production_enrichment
      targets:
        - name: production_elasticsearch
    
    - name: development_logs
      if: "kubernetes.namespace == 'development'"
      pipelines:
        - name: dev_enrichment
      targets:
        - name: development_elasticsearch
  ```

## Implementation Strategies

The following aspects of your telemetry stream must be considered im the implementation of routes:

* **Conditional Routing**:

  Selecting events involves evaluating boolean expressions such as:
  
  > `device.type == 'syslog'`  
  > `dataset.name == 'firewall_logs'`  
  > `log.severity > 4`  
  > `!(source.ip == '10.0.0.1'||source.ip == '10.0.0.2')`

  Key points about route evaluation:

  * Route conditions are evaluated before pipelines begin their work
  * The first route that matches processes the event
  * Pipelines can modify the flow or direction of the data
  * Multiple targets receive identical copies of the same data

  Examples of conditional routing:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: critical_alerts
      if: "event.severity == 'critical'||event.severity == 'high'"
      pipelines:
        - name: alert_enrichment
      targets:
        - name: alerts_webhook
        - name: security_team_email
    
    - name: normal_logs
      if: "event.severity == 'low'||event.severity == 'medium'"
      pipelines:
        - name: standard_processing
      targets:
        - name: logs_elasticsearch
  ```

* **Priority-Based Processing**:

  Routes with higher priority&mdash;which is indicated by their relative position in the tree&mdash;are processed first:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: urgent_alerts
      if: "event.severity == 'critical'"
      targets:
        - name: alerting_system
    
    - name: security_events
      if: "event.category == 'security'"
      targets:
        - name: security_platform
    
    - name: general_logs
      targets:
        - name: log_storage
  ```

* **Device Selection**:

  Routes can collect data from specific devices:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: network_traffic
      devices:
        - name: firewall_logs
        - name: router_logs
        - name: switch_logs
      pipelines:
        - name: network_enrichment
      targets:
        - name: network_monitoring
  ```

* **Pipeline Chaining**:

  Routes can apply multiple pipelines in sequence:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: web_security
      devices:
        - web_server_logs
      if: "event.category == 'web' && event.type == 'attack'"
      pipelines:
        - common_enrichment  # Applied first
        - attack_detection   # Applied second
        - threat_scoring     # Applied third
      targets:
        - security_elasticsearch
  ```

* **Multi-Target Delivery**:

  Routes can send processed data to multiple destinations:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: compliance_events
      if: "tags.contains('compliance')"
      pipelines:
        - name: compliance_formatting
      targets:
        - name: compliance_elasticsearch  # For searching and analytics
        - name: compliance_s3             # For long-term retention
        - name: auditor_webhook           # For real-time notification
  ```

* **Fallback Routes**:

  Routes without conditions act as catch-all handlers for unmatched events:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: primary_security
      if: "event.category == 'security'"
      targets:
        - name: security_elasticsearch
    
    - name: fallback_route
      # No if means this captures everything not matched above
      targets:
        - name: general_elasticsearch
  ```

* **Route Templates**:

  Use environment variables for flexible configurations.

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: dynamic_routing
      if: "${ROUTING_CONDITION}"
      pipelines:
        - ${PRIMARY_PIPELINE}
        - ${SECONDARY_PIPELINE}
      targets:
        - ${TARGET_SYSTEM}
  ```

* **Conditional Targets**:

  Apply different targets based on event properties.

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: adaptive_routing
      pipelines:
        - name: event_classifier
          processors:
            - set:
                field: _route_target
                value: "{{ event.priority > 7 ? 'high_priority' : 'standard' }}"
      targets:      
        - script:
          source:|
            if (ctx._route_target == 'high_priority') {
              return ['urgent_elasticsearch', 'notification_system'];
            } else {
              return ['standard_elasticsearch'];
            }
  ```
