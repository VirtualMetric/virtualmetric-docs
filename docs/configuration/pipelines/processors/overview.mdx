# Processors: Overview

Processors are fundamental components in log processing pipelines that perform specific operations on log data. They are responsible for transforming, enriching, and manipulating log entries as they flow through the system. Each processor is designed to handle a specific type of operation, from simple field modifications to complex data transformations.

## 🧠 AI

AI processors harness the power of artificial intelligence APIs for sophisticated content analysis and processing. These processors utilize various AI services to perform advanced text analysis, classification, and generation tasks. They enable intelligent processing of content, making it possible to extract insights and meaning from complex data.
