# Continue

## Synopsis

Drops the current event from processing.

## Schema

```yaml
- continue:
    description: <text>
    if: <script>
    ignore_failure: <boolean>
    on_failure: <processor[]>
    on_success: <processor[]>
    tag: <string>
```

## Configuration

The following fields are used to define the processor:

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`description`|N|-|Explanatory note|
|`if`|N|-|Condition to run|
|`ignore_failure`|N|`false`|Continue processing if operation fails|
|`on_failure`|N|-|See <Topic id="handling-failures">Handling Failures</Topic>|
|`on_success`|N|-|See <Topic id="handling-success">Handling Success</Topic>|
|`tag`|N|-|Identifier|

## Details

Drops the current event from processing by returning an error that signals the pipeline to discard the event. When this processor executes, the event is not sent to any configured targets and no further processors run.

Despite its name, the `continue` processor does NOT continue processing. It drops events from the pipeline, identical in behavior to the <Topic id="return">`return`</Topic>, <Topic id="final">`final`</Topic>, and <Topic id="drop">`drop`</Topic> processors.

The event is dropped after any `on_success` processors execute, allowing for cleanup operations, logging, or metrics collection before the event is discarded.

:::warning Misleading Name
The `continue` processor name is misleading. It does NOT continue to the next processor - it **drops the event completely**. Use <Topic id="return">`return`</Topic>, <Topic id="final">`final`</Topic>, or <Topic id="drop">`drop`</Topic> for clearer intent.
:::

:::note Event Dropping Processors
All these processors drop events identically: `continue`, <Topic id="return">`return`</Topic>, <Topic id="final">`final`</Topic>, and <Topic id="drop">`drop`</Topic>. They differ only in semantic naming. Use processor names that clearly communicate intent to avoid confusion.
:::

:::warning
The `continue` processor with success/failure chains will execute those chains before dropping the event. This allows for cleanup operations, logging, or metrics collection, but the event will still be discarded and not sent to any targets.

## Examples

### Basic Event Dropping

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Dropping events using continue processor...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - continue:
        if: "logEntry.level == 'INFO'"
        description: "Drop INFO level logs"
    - set:
        field: processed
        value: true
    ```
  </CodeCol>
  <CommentCol>
    event is dropped, subsequent processors skipped:
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```json
    {
      "level": "INFO",
      "message": "User logged in"
    }
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Conditional Event Filtering

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Dropping successful events conditionally...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - continue:
        if: "logEntry.status == 'success'"
        description: "Drop successful events"
    - set:
        field: processed
        value: true
    ```
  </CodeCol>
  <CommentCol>
    event is dropped when condition matches:
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success"
    }
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Drop with Metrics Collection

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Recording metrics before dropping event...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - continue:
        description: "Drop event with metrics"
        on_success:
          - set:
              field: drop_reason
              value: "filtered_by_continue"
    ```
  </CodeCol>
  <CommentCol>
    records metadata before event is dropped:
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```json
    {
      "original_data": "value",
      "drop_reason": "filtered_by_continue"
    }
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Filtering Within Conditional Blocks

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Dropping events within conditional logic...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - iff:
        if: "logEntry.type == 'audit'"
        processors:
          - continue:
              if: "logEntry.severity < 5"
              description: "Drop low severity audit logs"
          - enrich:
              field: user_id
              target: user_info
    ```
  </CodeCol>
  <CommentCol>
    low severity audit events are dropped:
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```json
    {
      "type": "audit",
      "severity": 3
    }
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Drop on Validation Failure

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Dropping events that fail validation...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - validate:
        field: email
        pattern: ".*@.*"
        on_failure:
          - set:
              field: email_valid
              value: false
          - continue:
              description: "Drop events with invalid email"
    ```
  </CodeCol>
  <CommentCol>
    event is dropped after validation failure:
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```json
    {
      "email": "invalid-email",
      "email_valid": false
    }
    ```
  </CodeCol>
