description: Reduces data volume by sampling log entries based on configurable rules
---

# Sample

## Synopsis

```yaml {2-4}
- sample:
  rules: <rule[]>
  exclude_filters: <string[]>
  tag: <string>
  description: <text>
  if: <script>
  ignore_failure: <boolean>
  ignore_missing: <boolean>
  on_failure: <processor[]>
  on_success: <processor[]>
```

## Description

**Functionality**: Reduces data volume by implementing systematic sampling of log entries based on configurable rules. The processor keeps one event for every N matching events, where N is the specified sampling rate, allowing for efficient data reduction while maintaining statistical representation.

Rule-based sampling provides fine-grained control over which types of events are sampled and at what rates. This helps balance data volume with analytical needs by keeping all critical events while sampling high-volume, routine events.

## Parameters

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`rules`|N|-|List of sampling rules with filters and rates|
|`exclude_filters`|N|-|List of conditions to exclude events from sampling|
|`description`|N|-|Explanatory note|
|`if`|N|-|Condition to run|
|`ignore_failure`|N|`false`|Continue processing if sampling fails|
|`ignore_missing`|N|`false`|Skip if referenced fields don't exist|
|`on_failure`|N|-|Error handling processors|
|`on_success`|N|-|Success handling processors|
|`tag`|N|-|Identifier|

## Sampling Rule Object

Each rule in the `rules` array is an object with the following properties:

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`filter`|Y|-|Condition that determines which events this rule applies to|
|`sampling_rate`|Y|`2`|Keep 1 event for every N events (integer or string template)|

## Examples

### Basic Sampling

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Apply simple 1:10 sampling...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - sample:
        rules:
          - filter: "true"
            sampling_rate: 10
    ```
  </CodeCol>
  <CommentCol>
    keeps every 10th event, reducing volume by 90%
  </CommentCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Conditional Sampling

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Apply different sampling rates based on log level...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - sample:
        rules:
          - filter: "logEntry.log.level == 'debug'"
            sampling_rate: 100
          - filter: "logEntry.log.level == 'info'"
            sampling_rate: 10
          - filter: "logEntry.log.level == 'warning'"
            sampling_rate: 2
        exclude_filters:
          - "logEntry.log.level == 'error'"
          - "logEntry.log.level == 'critical'"
    ```
  </CodeCol>
  <CommentCol>
    keeps all error/critical logs, 50% of warnings, 10% of info, and 1% of debug logs

  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - sample:
        rules:
          - filter: "hasField(logEntry, 'http.response.status_code')"
            sampling_rate: "{{config.sampling_rates.http}}"
          - filter: "hasField(logEntry, 'database.query')"
            sampling_rate: "{{config.sampling_rates.db}}"
    ```
  </CodeCol>
  <CommentCol>
    applies configurable rates from system settings

### Service-Based Sampling

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Sample differently based on service...

  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - sample:
        rules:
          - filter: "logEntry.service.name == 'frontend'"
            sampling_rate: 5
          - filter: "logEntry.service.name == 'backend-api'"
            sampling_rate: 20
          - filter: "logEntry.service.name == 'auth-service'"
            sampling_rate: 2
        exclude_filters:
          - "hasField(logEntry, 'error.message')"
          - "logEntry.event.outcome == 'failure'"
    ```

    ```yaml
    - sample:
        if: "logEntry.environment == 'production'"
        rules:
          - filter: "logEntry.http.request.method == 'GET' && logEntry.http.response.status_code >= 200 && logEntry.http.response.status_code < 300"
            sampling_rate: 50
          - filter: "logEntry.http.request.method == 'GET' && logEntry.http.response.status_code >= 400 && logEntry.http.response.status_code < 500"
            sampling_rate: 5
          - filter: "logEntry.event.category == 'database' && logEntry.event.duration < 100"
            sampling_rate: 20
        exclude_filters:
          - "logEntry.http.response.status_code >= 500"
          - "logEntry.event.severity >= 70"
          - "logEntry.http.request.method != 'GET'"
          - "logEntry.event.duration >= 1000"
          - "logEntry.user.id == 'admin'"
    ```

:::note
The processor adds a metadata field `_vmetric.sampled` to sampled events, showing the current sampling rate (e.g., "10:1"). This information is useful for adjusting statistics during analysis to account for sampling.
:::

:::warning
Sampling inherently discards data, so use with caution for critical events. Always use `exclude_filters` to preserve important events like errors, alerts, or security incidents that require 100% preservation regardless of volume.
