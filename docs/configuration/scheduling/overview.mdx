# Overview

## Overview

Execution timing capabilities provide powerful control over when and how often your telemetry pipeline components execute. By adding temporal logic to targets and routes, you can optimize resource usage, reduce costs, implement time-based routing strategies, and align data processing with business requirements.

## What You Can Do

### Control Execution Timing

Execute components at specific times or regular intervals:

- **Targets**: Control when data is sent to destinations
- **Routes**: Control when data flows through specific paths

### Optimize Resource Usage

Reduce system load by processing data during specific time windows:

- Run expensive operations during off-peak hours
- Batch data processing to reduce API calls
- Schedule resource-intensive targets for low-traffic periods
- Implement graduated data retention strategies

### Implement Business Logic

Align data processing with business schedules:

- Process data only during business hours
- Route critical logs differently during peak times
- Archive data on specific days or times
- Create time-based data tiers (hot, warm, cold)

### Reduce Costs

Minimize expenses by controlling when and how often components execute:

- Batch API calls to reduce per-request costs
- Route data to expensive services less frequently
- Use cheaper storage during off-peak hours
- Implement cost-effective retention policies

## Timing Methods

The platform provides two complementary approaches to time-based execution:

### Cron

Execute components at specific times using cron expressions.

**Best for:**
- Time-specific execution (daily at 3 AM, weekdays at 9 AM)
- Business hour constraints
- Calendar-based patterns (monthly reports, weekend processing)
- Complex time windows

### Interval

Execute components at regular intervals using simple time units.

**Best for:**
- Regular periodic execution (every 5 minutes, every hour)
- Simple batching strategies
- Predictable resource consumption
- Straightforward configuration

- Realtime monitoring in production
- Environment-appropriate SLAs

## Configuration Patterns

### Combining Cron and Interval

Use both for different components in the same pipeline:

```yaml
# Cron-based target for compliance
targets:
  - name: compliance_target
    type: awss3
    properties:
      cron: "0 0 * * *"
      bucket: "compliance-logs"

# Interval-based target for monitoring
targets:
  - name: monitoring_target
    type: elastic
    properties:
      interval: "5m"
      index: "monitoring"

# Realtime target for alerts
targets:
  - name: alert_target
    type: splunk
    properties:
      # No cron or interval - realtime
      index: "alerts"
```

### Conditional Time-Based Routes

Create fallback routing with time constraints:

```yaml
routes:
  # Priority 1: Business hours to premium service
  - name: priority_route
    source: "logs"
    destination: "premium_target"
    properties:
      cron: "* 9-17 * * 1-5"

  # Priority 2: Night hours to standard service
  - name: night_route
    source: "logs"
    destination: "standard_target"
    properties:
      cron: "* 0-8,18-23 * * *"

  # Priority 3: Weekend to basic service
  - name: weekend_route
    source: "logs"
    destination: "basic_target"
    properties:
      cron: "* * * * 0,6"

  # Default: fallback to archive
  - name: fallback_route
    source: "logs"
    destination: "archive_target"
```

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

Begin with interval-based execution for straightforward use cases:

```yaml
properties:
  interval: "5m"
```

Migrate to cron when you need specific timing:

```yaml
properties:
  cron: "0 */6 * * *"
```

### Consider Data Volume

Match timing configuration to expected data volume:

- **High volume**: Use longer intervals or specific cron schedules
- **Low volume**: Realtime or short intervals work well
- **Variable volume**: Use time-based routing to handle peaks

### Monitor Queue Depth

Between scheduled executions, data accumulates in queues:

- Monitor queue sizes to prevent memory issues
- Adjust intervals if queues grow too large
- Balance batch size with interval duration

### Document Timezone Assumptions

All cron schedules use system local time:

```yaml
# Runs at midnight system local time
properties:
  cron: "0 0 * * *"
```

Always document expected timezone in configuration comments.

### Test Cron Expressions

Validate cron expressions before deployment:

- Use online cron validators
- Test in development environment first
- Document intended execution times

### Plan for Failures

Cron-based components don't retry immediately:

- Failed executions wait for next scheduled time
- Ensure monitoring alerts for execution failures
- Consider redundant routes for critical data

## Performance Impact

### Memory Considerations

Longer intervals mean larger queues:

- **Short intervals (< 5m)**: Smaller queues, higher CPU
- **Long intervals (> 1h)**: Larger queues, lower CPU
- Balance based on available memory and data volume

### Network Impact

Timing configuration affects network patterns:

- **Realtime**: Constant network usage
- **Short intervals**: Frequent bursts
- **Long intervals**: Large periodic bursts
- Plan network capacity accordingly

### Processing Latency

Consider end-to-end latency requirements:

- **Realtime needs**: Omit timing configuration
- **Near-realtime (< 5m)**: Short intervals
- **Batch processing**: Longer intervals or cron schedules
- **Compliance**: Cron-based with guaranteed execution times

## Migration Strategies

### From Realtime to Scheduled

Gradually introduce timing controls to reduce costs:

1. Start with realtime (no timing configuration)
2. Add long intervals (1h+) during testing
3. Refine intervals based on actual needs
4. Migrate to cron schedules for specific timing requirements

### From Scheduled to Realtime

Increase processing frequency for better latency:

1. Start with daily cron schedules
2. Move to hourly intervals
3. Reduce to 15-minute intervals
4. Remove timing configuration for realtime processing

## Summary

Time-based execution provides essential control over telemetry pipeline behavior. By combining cron and interval timing with routes and targets, you can:

- Optimize resource usage and reduce costs
- Implement sophisticated data lifecycle policies
- Align processing with business requirements
- Create resilient, efficient data pipelines

Start with simple intervals for regular processing, then add cron-based logic for complex time-aware workflows.
