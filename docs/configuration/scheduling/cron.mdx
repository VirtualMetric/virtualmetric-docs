# Cron

## Synopsis

Cron-based execution allows targets and routes to run at specific times using cron expressions. Instead of running continuously, the component will only process data when the cron schedule condition is met.

## Schema

### Targets

```yaml
targets:
  - name: <string>
    type: <string>
    properties:
      cron: <string>
      # target-specific properties
```

### Routes

```yaml
routes:
  - name: <string>
    source: <string>
    destination: <string>
    properties:
      cron: <string>
```

## Configuration

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`cron`|N|-|Cron expression defining when the component should execute|

## Details

The cron field accepts standard cron expressions to control when a target or route executes. This is useful for scenarios where you want to:

- Process data at specific times of day
- Run components during off-peak hours
- Align execution with business schedules
- Reduce resource consumption by limiting execution windows
- Create time-based routing logic

When a cron schedule is configured, the component will only process queued data when the current time matches the cron expression. Between scheduled executions, data accumulates in the queue and is processed during the next scheduled window.

### Cron Expression Format

Standard cron format with five fields:

```
┌───────────── minute (0-59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0-23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0-6, Sunday=0)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Special Characters

- `*` - Any value
- `,` - Value list separator
- `-` - Range of values
- `/` - Step values

### Time Zone

All cron expressions are evaluated in the system's local timezone.

## Usage Notes

- Cron takes precedence over interval if both are configured
- Data queues up between scheduled executions
- First execution occurs at the next matching time after component initialization
- Failed executions do not trigger immediate retries, they wait for the next scheduled time
- Use cron for predictable, time-based execution patterns
- For high-frequency or continuous processing, omit cron or use interval instead
- Multiple routes can have different cron schedules, creating time-based routing logic

## Troubleshooting

### Component Not Executing

Check that:
- Cron expression is valid
- System timezone matches your expectations
- Component status is enabled
- Queue contains data to process

### Missed Executions

If executions are being skipped:
- Verify the cron expression matches your intended schedule
- Check system logs for errors during execution attempts
- Ensure previous execution completed before next scheduled time

### Timezone Issues

All cron schedules use the system's local timezone. If your logs show unexpected execution times:
- Verify system timezone configuration
- Consider adjusting cron expression to match your timezone
- Document timezone expectations in component descriptions
