# Devices: Management

The **Devices** web interface provides comprehensive management for data collection sources through an intuitive card-based dashboard.

## Accessing Devices Dashboard

Navigate to the Devices management interface:

- Go to **Home** > **Fleet Management** > **Devices**

-or-

- Click the hamburger menu on the top left
- Select **Fleet Management** > **Devices**

## Devices Overview

The Devices dashboard is where you manage all data collection sources for **DataStream**. Devices are data listeners that receive telemetry from external sources and convert it to standardized pipeline input format.

### Device Categories

**DataStream** organizes devices into two fundamental categories:

**Push Devices:**
- Receive data pushed from external sources
- Network-based listeners on Director
- Examples: Syslog servers, HTTP endpoints, TCP/UDP listeners
- Director opens ports and waits for incoming data

**Pull Devices:**
- Actively collect data from remote sources
- Agent-based or cloud-based collection
- Examples: Windows/Linux Agents, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Blob Storage
- Director or Agent connects to remote sources to retrieve data

### Dashboard Interface

The overview page displays all available device types as cards organized by category.

**Search and Filter:**
- **Search devices** - Filter device types by name in the search field
- **Category Filter** - ButtonGroup with device counts:
  - **All** - Show all device types
  - **Push** - Show only Push device types
  - **Pull** - Show only Pull device types
- Card count display shows "Viewing X devices" or "No devices found"

**Device Cards:**

Each device type displays as a card showing:
- **Icon** - Visual identifier for the device type
- **Title** - Device type name
- **Description** - Brief explanation of device purpose
- **Enabled Count** - Number of active instances
- **Disabled Count** - Number of inactive instances
- **Coming Soon Tag** - For unavailable device types

Clicking a device card navigates to that device type's management page.

### Available Device Types

**Push Devices (5 types):**
- **Syslog** - RFC-compliant syslog message receiver
- **HTTP** - REST endpoint for HTTP/HTTPS ingestion
- **UDP** - UDP datagram listener
- **TCP** - TCP stream listener
- **eStreamer** - Cisco Firepower event stream receiver

**Pull Devices (4 types):**
- **Windows** - Windows Agent for log collection
- **Linux** - Linux Agent for log collection
- **Azure Blob Storage** - Azure Blob container file reader
- **Azure Event Hubs** - Azure Event Hubs consumer

## Best Practices

### Device Organization

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use descriptive, meaningful device names
- Include location or purpose in name (e.g., "datacenter-syslog-01")
- Maintain consistent naming pattern across devices
- Avoid generic names like "device1" or "test"

**Tag Usage:**
- Apply tags for categorization (environment, datacenter, application)
- Use tags for bulk filtering and management
- Maintain consistent tag vocabulary across organization
- Document tag meanings for team reference

### Status Management

**Enabled Status:**
- Keep devices "Enabled" for active data collection
- Monitor connection status regularly
- Investigate "Not Connected" status immediately
- Review device logs for connectivity issues

**Disabled Status:**
- Use "Disabled" status for maintenance windows
- Disable devices during configuration changes
- Document reason for disabling in external systems
- Re-enable after maintenance completion

### Configuration Management

**Push Devices:**
- Verify port availability before configuration
- Test network connectivity to device ports
- Configure TLS for sensitive data streams
- Monitor buffer usage under high load

**Pull Devices (Agent-Based):**
- Complete Agent installation before device creation
- Verify Agent connection status in Agent Deployment tab
- Monitor Agent History for connection issues
- Update Agent definitions when log requirements change

**Pull Devices (Cloud-Based):**
- Validate Azure credentials before configuration
- Test connection to cloud services
- Monitor error logs for authentication issues
- Verify appropriate permissions for cloud resources

### Lifecycle Management

**Creation:**
- Assign to appropriate Director for workload distribution
- Configure all required fields before creation
- Test device immediately after creation
- Verify data flow through associated routes

**Maintenance:**
- Review device detail tabs periodically
- Keep device configurations synchronized
- Monitor Agent History for patterns
- Test configuration changes in non-production first

**Deletion:**
- Verify no active dependencies before deletion
