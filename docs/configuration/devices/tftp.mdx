# TFTP

<span className="theme-doc-version-badge badge badge--secondary">Pull</span>

## Synopsis

Creates a server that accepts file uploads using the TFTP protocol. Supports IP-based device mapping, multiple workers, and automatic file content processing.

## Schema

```yaml {2,3,5}
- id: <numeric>
  name: <string>
  description: <string>
  type: tftp
  tags: <string[]>
  pipelines: <pipeline[]>
  status: <boolean>
  properties:
    address: <string>
    port: <numeric>
    reuse: <boolean>
    workers: <numeric>
    buffer_size: <numeric>
```

## Configuration

The following fields are used to define the device:

### Device

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`id`|Y||Unique identifier|
|`name`|Y||Device name|
|`description`|N|-|Optional description|
|`type`|Y||Must be `tftp`|
|`tags`|N|-|Optional tags|
|`pipelines`|N|-|Optional pre-processor pipelines|
|`status`|N|`true`|Enable/disable the device|

### Connection

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`address`|N|`"0.0.0.0"`|Listen address|
|`port`|Y||Listen port (typically 69)|

### Performance

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`reuse`|N|`false`|Enable multi-worker mode|
|`workers`|N|`4`|Number of worker processes when reuse enabled|
|`buffer_size`|N|`9000`|Read buffer size in bytes|

:::warning
TFTP protocol does **not** support authentication. Deploy only on _trusted_ networks.

## Key Features

The following are unique features that **Director** offers.

### IP-Based Device Mapping

The server supports automatic device mapping based on client IP addresses: it maps incoming client IPs to device IDs, and  automatically associates uploads with devices. It also supports dynamic device discovery and maintains an IP-to-device mapping cache.

### Files

The server processes uploaded files by reading the file contents into memory, recording upload metadata (filename, timestamp, etc.), capturing the client information, and converting the content to consumable format.

### Multiple Workers

When `reuse` is enabled, the server uses multiple workers which maintain their own TFTP listeners and process files independently so that the files are automatically distributed.

:::note
The worker count will be capped at the number of available CPU cores.
:::

### Upload

The device upload operations observe the following procedure:

* The client initiates a TFTP upload

* The server accepts the connection
  
* The client transfers the file

* Finally, the server maps the client IP to the device, reads the file contents, applies the pipelines, and saves the processed data to a store.

:::tip
Configure clients to use binary mode for file transfers to avoid data corruption.

## Examples

The following are commonly used configuration types.

### Basic

A basic server can be created easily:

<ExampleGrid>

    Creating a simple TFTP server...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    devices:
      - id: 1
        name: basic_tftp
        type: tftp
        properties:
          address: "0.0.0.0"
          port: 69
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Device Mapping

Devices can be automatically captured:

  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    devices:
      - id: 2
        name: mapped_tftp
        type: tftp
        properties:
          address: "0.0.0.0"
          port: 69
          reuse: false
          buffer_size: 16384
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Multiple Devices

Uploads from multiple devices can be handled easily:

  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    devices:
      - id: 4
        name: multi_device_tftp
        type: tftp
        properties:
          address: "0.0.0.0"
          port: 69
          reuse: true
          workers: 2
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

:::warning
Ensure all devices are configured to use the same TFTP server port.
:::

### High-Volume

Performance can be enhanced for high file upload volumes:

  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    devices:
      - id: 3
        name: performant_tftp
        type: tftp
        properties:
          address: "0.0.0.0"
          port: 69
          reuse: true
          workers: 4
          buffer_size: 32768
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Pipelines

File contents can be handled according to requirements:

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Applying custom processing to uploaded files...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    devices:
      - id: 5
        name: pipeline_tftp
        type: tftp
        pipelines:
          - config_parser
          - field_extractor
        properties:
          address: "0.0.0.0"
          port: 69
          buffer_size: 16384
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

:::note
Pipelines are processed sequentially, and can modify or drop content before ingestion.
