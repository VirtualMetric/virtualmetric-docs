# Routes: Overview

Routes define how incoming data is filtered, processed, and directed to specific destinations. They act as traffic controllers, determining what data goes through which pipelines and ultimately reaches which targets.

## Definitions

Routes are made up of filtering expressions and sequences of processors that shape the format and flow of data streams. They curate data through an evaluation process and forward it to downstream consumers.

Their behavior is characterized by three key elements:

<TermTable>
  <TermCol>**Conditions**</TermCol>
  <DefCol>Optional filter expressions that match specific events</DefCol>

  <TermCol>**Pipelines**</TermCol>
  <DefCol>Optional processing schemes applied to selected events</DefCol>

  <TermCol>**Targets**</TermCol>
  <DefCol>One or more destinations to forward the processed data</DefCol>
</TermTable>

### Deployment

Forwarding data involves several design patterns (use of pipelines is optional in each case):

* Single source to single target
  > Syslog &map; Route &map; [_Normalize_] &map; Storage

* Single source to multiple targets
  > Syslog &map; Route &map; [_Enrich_] &map; Monitoring + Storage + Backup

* Multiple sources to single target
  > Syslog + Apache &map; Route [_Normalize_] &map; Central Analytics

* Multiple sources to multiple targets
  > Syslog + Winlog + Apache &map; Route [_Normalize_ &compfn; _Enrich_] &map; Cloud Upload + Central Analytics

Routes can include zero or more pipelines. Multiple pipelines will process data sequentially. A pipeline's processors can override routing using the `reroute` processor, and the `final` processor terminates execution.

## Configuration

All routes share the following base configuration fields:

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | Y | | Unique identifier for the route |
| `description` | N | | Optional explanation of the route's purpose |
| `devices` | N | | List of source IDs to collect events from |
| `condition` | N | | Expression determining if the route applies to an event |
| `pipelines` | N | | Ordered list of pipelines to process matching events |
| `targets` | N | | List of targets to deliver processed events to |
| `status` | N | `true` | Enable/disable the route |
| `order` | N | `0` | Processing priority (lower numbers processed first) |

:::warning
Do _not_ confuse field names like `pipelines` or `targets` with the component entries at the first level. As the highest level of a telemetry configuration, routes orchestrate the stream by specifying the components that compose the traffic.
:::

:::note
Enlisted devices, targets, and pipelines must be pre-configured to be usable by routes. Use their ids or names to refer to them.
:::

**Example**:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: syslog_to_backup
    devices: 
      - name: syslog_*
    pipelines: 
      - name: normalize
      - name: enrich
    targets: 
      - name: backup
```

This route receives data from devices with the prefix `syslog_` in their names, transforms it using the `normalize` and `enrich` pipelines, and forwards it to the `backup` target.

## Management

Managing routes effectively is crucial for maintaining an efficient data flow in your environment.

A route definition links input sources, processing pipelines, and output targets with conditional logic:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: security_events
    description: "Route security-related events"
    devices:
      - name: firewall_logs
      - name: ids_logs
    condition: "event.category == 'security'"
    pipelines:
      - name: security_enrichment
      - name: threat_scoring
    targets:
      - name: security_elasticsearch
      - name: siem_platform
```

### Creation and Modification

Routes can be:
* **created** through configuration files or the management interface
* **edited** to update parameters, conditions, pipeline assignments, and target configurations
* **moved** to change their order, adjust processing priorities, and optimize data flow
* **copied** to duplicate existing routes for other purposes
* **disabled** or **deleted** when no longer needed

### Organization

Routes can be organized by:
* **Priority** - Routes are evaluated in order based on their priority, from specific to general
* **Groups** - Routes can be grouped by function or by source

### Performance

Route performance can be optimized by:
* **Conditions** - Use efficient filters, minimize complex conditions, remove redundant checks
* **Pipelines** - Reduce unnecessary processing, streamline transformation logic
* **Targets** - Balance load across targets, optimize batch sizes

For clusters, manage:
* **Configuration syncing** - Maintain consistent configurations across nodes
* **Load distribution** - Balance processing across the cluster

## Conditional Routing

Selecting events involves evaluating boolean expressions such as:
> `device.type == 'syslog'`  
> `dataset.name == 'firewall_logs'`  
> `log.severity > 4`  
> `!(source.ip == '10.0.0.1' || source.ip == '10.0.0.2')`

### Evaluation

Key points about route evaluation:
* Route conditions are evaluated before pipelines begin their work
* The first route that matches processes the event
* Pipelines can modify the flow or direction of the data
* Multiple targets receive identical copies of the same data

:::tip
To optimize performance: minimize the number of routes, avoid unnecessary pipeline duplications, filter as early as possible with clear expressions, and carefully consider the evaluation order.
:::

Examples of conditional routing:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: critical_alerts
    condition: "event.severity == 'critical' || event.severity == 'high'"
    pipelines:
      - name: alert_enrichment
    targets:
      - name: alerts_webhook
      - name: security_team_email
  
  - name: normal_logs
    condition: "event.severity == 'low' || event.severity == 'medium'"
    pipelines:
      - name: standard_processing
    targets:
      - name: logs_elasticsearch
```

Routes with lower `order` values are processed first:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: urgent_alerts
    order: 10  # Processed first
    condition: "event.severity == 'critical'"
    targets:
      - name: alerting_system
  
  - name: security_events
    order: 20  # Processed second
    condition: "event.category == 'security'"
    targets:
      - name: security_platform
  
  - name: general_logs
    order: 30  # Processed third
    targets:
      - name: log_storage
```

### Devices Selection

Routes can collect data from specific devices:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: network_traffic
    devices:
      - name: firewall_logs
      - name: router_logs
      - name: switch_logs
    pipelines:
      - name: network_enrichment
    targets:
      - name: network_monitoring
```

### Pipeline Chaining

Routes can apply multiple pipelines in sequence:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: web_security
    devices:
      - web_server_logs
    condition: "event.category == 'web' && event.type == 'attack'"
    pipelines:
      - common_enrichment  # Applied first
      - attack_detection   # Applied second
      - threat_scoring     # Applied third
    targets:
      - security_elasticsearch
```

### Multi-Target Delivery

Routes can send processed data to multiple destinations:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: compliance_events
    condition: "tags.contains('compliance')"
    pipelines:
      - name: compliance_formatting
    targets:
      - name: compliance_elasticsearch  # For searching and analytics
      - name: compliance_s3             # For long-term retention
      - name: auditor_webhook           # For real-time notification
```

### Fallback Routes

Routes without conditions act as catch-all handlers for unmatched events:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: primary_security
    condition: "event.category == 'security'"
    targets:
      - name: security_elasticsearch
  
  - name: fallback_route
    # No condition means this captures everything not matched above
    targets:
      - name: general_elasticsearch
```

## Use Cases

Some scenarios demonstrating the uses of routes:

### Common

* **Security Event Workflow**:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: security_critical
      order: 10
      condition: "event.category == 'security' && event.severity == 'critical'"
      pipelines:
        - name: security_enrichment
        - name: threat_intelligence
      targets:
        - name: siem_platform
        - name: security_team_notification
    
    - name: security_standard
      order: 20
      condition: "event.category == 'security'"
      pipelines:
        - name: security_enrichment
      targets:
        - name: security_elasticsearch
  ```

* **Data Segregation**:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: pci_data
      condition: "tags.contains('pci')"
      pipelines:
        - name: pci_compliance
        - name: data_masking
      targets:
        - name: pci_storage
    
    - name: hipaa_data
      condition: "tags.contains('hipaa')"
      pipelines:
        - name: hipaa_compliance
        - name: phi_protection
      targets:
        - name: hipaa_storage
  ```

* **Environment Separation**:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: production_logs
      condition: "kubernetes.namespace == 'production'"
      pipelines:
        - name: production_enrichment
      targets:
        - name: production_elasticsearch
    
    - name: development_logs
      condition: "kubernetes.namespace == 'development'"
      pipelines:
        - name: dev_enrichment
      targets:
        - name: development_elasticsearch
  ```

### Advanced

* **Route Templates**: Use environment variables for flexible configurations:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: dynamic_routing
      condition: "${ROUTING_CONDITION}"
      pipelines:
        - ${PRIMARY_PIPELINE}
        - ${SECONDARY_PIPELINE}
      targets:
        - ${TARGET_SYSTEM}
  ```

* **Conditional Targets**: Apply different targets based on event properties:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: adaptive_routing
      pipelines:
        - name: event_classifier
        processors:
          - set:
            field: _route_target
            value: "{{ event.priority > 7 ? 'high_priority' : 'standard' }}"
      targets:      
        - script:
          source: |
            if (ctx._route_target == 'high_priority') {
              return ['urgent_elasticsearch', 'notification_system'];
            } else {
              return ['standard_elasticsearch'];
            }
  ```

* **Complex Conditions**: Create sophisticated routing logic:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: complex_routing
      condition: |
        (event.category == 'security' && 
        (event.severity == 'high' || event.severity == 'critical')) ||
        (event.category == 'network' && event.action == 'blocked' && 
        source.ip != null && !source.ip.startsWith('10.'))
      pipelines:
        - name: security_enrichment
      targets:
        - name: security_elasticsearch
  ```

### Complete Example

```yaml
routes:
  - name: critical_security
    order: 10
    condition: "event.category == 'security' && event.severity == 'critical'"
    pipelines:
      - name: security_enrichment
      - name: threat_intelligence
    targets:
      - name: security_elasticsearch
      - name: security_team_notification
  
  - name: network_security
    order: 20
    devices:
      - name: firewall_logs
      - name: ids_logs
    condition: "event.category == 'security'"
    pipelines:
      - name: network_enrichment
      - name: security_enrichment
    targets:
      - name: security_elasticsearch
  
  - name: web_application
    order: 30
    devices:
      - name: web_server_logs
      - name: application_logs
    pipelines:
      - name: web_log_enrichment
    targets:
      - name: application_elasticsearch  
  
  - name: compliance_events
    order: 40
    condition: "tags.contains('compliance')"
    pipelines:
      - name: compliance_formatting
    targets:
      - name: compliance_elasticsearch
      - name: compliance_s3
      
  - name: general_logs
    order: 50
    targets:
      - name: general_elasticsearch
```

## Best Practices

Guidelines for designing, using, and maintaining routes:

* **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names like `apache_to_analytics` and maintain consistency
* **Filtering**: Start with specific routes and use precise conditions, avoiding overlaps
* **Pipelines**: Use a single pipeline when possible and document multi-pipeline routes
* **Targets**: Collate similar targets and consider capacity and throughput

Key practices:
1. **Route Order**: Arrange routes from most specific to most general
2. **Use Fallbacks**: Create catch-all routes for unexpected events
3. **Optimize Conditions**: Write efficient conditions for high-throughput routes
4. **Balance Distribution**: Avoid overloading specific targets
5. **Monitor Flow**: Track route metrics to identify bottlenecks
6. **Test Coverage**: Verify routes handle all expected event types
7. **Document Logic**: Include clear descriptions for complex routing decisions

### Maintenance

For effective route management:
* **Versioning**: Track changes and maintain backups for recovery
* **Documentation**: Document purpose and dependencies
* **Testing**: Test new configurations and verify data flow
* **Security**: Manage permissions and secure sensitive data

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

* **Route not matching**: Verify conditions, check data format, review route order
* **Pipeline failures**: Check processor configurations and monitor resources
* **Target connectivity**: Verify network access and credentials

When troubleshooting, enable debug logging, review error messages, check configuration syntax, verify dependencies, and test any modified routes.
