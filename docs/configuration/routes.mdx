# Routes: Overview

Routes define how incoming data is filtered, processed, and directed to specific destinations. They act as traffic controllers, determining what data goes through which pipelines and ultimately reaches which targets.

## Definitions

Routes are made up of filtering expressions and sequences of processors that shape the format and flow of data streams. They curate data through an evaluation process and forward it to downstream consumers.

Their behavior is characterized by three key elements:

- **Devices** - One or more sources to ingest data from

- **Pipelines** - Optional processing schemes applied to selected events

- **Targets** - One or more destinations to forward the processed data

In addition to these, there is one more consideration that involves the binary relations between devices and pipelines, pipelines and targets, or directly devices and targets: the optional _filter expressions_ that match specific events.

## Configuration

All routes share the following base configuration fields:

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`name`|Y||Unique identifier for the route|
|`description`|N||Optional explanation of the route's purpose|
|`devices`|N||List of source IDs to collect events from|
|`if`|N||Expression determining if the route applies to an event|
|`pipelines`|N||Ordered list of pipelines to process matching events|
|`targets`|N||List of targets to deliver processed events to|
|`status`|N|`true`|Enable/disable the route|
|`order`|N|`0`|Processing priority (lower numbers processed first)|

:::warning
Do _not_ confuse field names like `pipelines` or `targets` with the component entries at the first level. As the highest level of a telemetry configuration, routes orchestrate the stream by specifying the components that compose the traffic.
:::

:::note
Enlisted devices, targets, and pipelines must be pre-configured to be usable by routes. Use their ids or names to refer to them.
:::

**Example**:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: syslog_to_backup
    devices: 
      - name: syslog_*
    pipelines: 
      - name: normalize
      - name: enrich
    targets: 
      - name: backup
```

This route receives data from devices with the prefix `syslog_` in their names, transforms it using the `normalize` and `enrich` pipelines, and forwards it to the `backup` target.

## Deployment

Forwarding data involves several design patterns (use of pipelines is optional in each case):

* Single source to single target
  > Syslog → Route → [_Normalize_] → Storage

* Single source to multiple targets
  > Syslog → Route → [_Enrich_] → Monitoring + Storage + Backup

* Multiple sources to single target
  > Syslog + Apache → Route [_Normalize_] → Central Analytics

* Multiple sources to multiple targets
  > Syslog + Winlog + Apache → Route [_Normalize_ ∘ _Enrich_] → Cloud Upload + Central Analytics

Routes can include zero or more pipelines. Multiple pipelines will process data sequentially. A pipeline's processors can override routing using the `reroute` processor, and the `final` processor terminates execution.

## Route Types

Routes can be categorized based on their function in the data flow:

* **Primary Routes** - These routes handle critical data paths with high priority:
  * Specific filtering, targeted processing, and specialized destinations
  
* **Filtering Routes** - These routes select specific subsets of data:
  * Data segregation based on categories, security levels, or compliance requirements
  
* **Processing Routes** - These routes apply transformations to data:
  * Apply enrichment, normalization, or specialized processing
  
* **Distribution Routes** - These routes focus on delivering data to targets:
  * Fan-out delivery, redundant storage, or multi-system integration
  
* **Fallback Routes** - These routes catch any unmatched events:
  * Default processing for events that don't match specific criteria

## Use Cases

Some scenarios demonstrating the uses of routes:

### Security Event Workflow

```yaml
routes:
  - name: security_critical
    order: 10
    if: "event.category == 'security' && event.severity == 'critical'"
    pipelines:
      - name: security_enrichment
      - name: threat_intelligence
    targets:
      - name: siem_platform
      - name: security_team_notification
  
  - name: security_standard
    order: 20
    if: "event.category == 'security'"
    pipelines:
      - name: security_enrichment
    targets:
      - name: security_elasticsearch
```

### Data Segregation

```yaml
routes:
  - name: pci_data
    if: "tags.contains('pci')"
    pipelines:
      - name: pci_compliance
      - name: data_masking
    targets:
      - name: pci_storage
  
  - name: hipaa_data
    if: "tags.contains('hipaa')"
    pipelines:
      - name: hipaa_compliance
      - name: phi_protection
    targets:
      - name: hipaa_storage
```

### Environment Separation

```yaml
routes:
  - name: production_logs
    if: "kubernetes.namespace == 'production'"
    pipelines:
      - name: production_enrichment
    targets:
      - name: production_elasticsearch
  
  - name: development_logs
    if: "kubernetes.namespace == 'development'"
    pipelines:
      - name: dev_enrichment
    targets:
      - name: development_elasticsearch
```

## Implementation Strategies

### Conditional Routing

Selecting events involves evaluating boolean expressions such as:
> `device.type == 'syslog'`  
> `dataset.name == 'firewall_logs'`  
> `log.severity > 4`  
> `!(source.ip == '10.0.0.1'||source.ip == '10.0.0.2')`

Key points about route evaluation:
* Route conditions are evaluated before pipelines begin their work
* The first route that matches processes the event
* Pipelines can modify the flow or direction of the data
* Multiple targets receive identical copies of the same data

Examples of conditional routing:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: critical_alerts
    if: "event.severity == 'critical'||event.severity == 'high'"
    pipelines:
      - name: alert_enrichment
    targets:
      - name: alerts_webhook
      - name: security_team_email
  
  - name: normal_logs
    if: "event.severity == 'low'||event.severity == 'medium'"
    pipelines:
      - name: standard_processing
    targets:
      - name: logs_elasticsearch
```

### Priority-Based Processing

Routes with lower `order` values are processed first:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: urgent_alerts
    order: 10  # Processed first
    if: "event.severity == 'critical'"
    targets:
      - name: alerting_system
  
  - name: security_events
    order: 20  # Processed second
    if: "event.category == 'security'"
    targets:
      - name: security_platform
  
  - name: general_logs
    order: 30  # Processed third
    targets:
      - name: log_storage
```

### Devices Selection

Routes can collect data from specific devices:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: network_traffic
    devices:
      - name: firewall_logs
      - name: router_logs
      - name: switch_logs
    pipelines:
      - name: network_enrichment
    targets:
      - name: network_monitoring
```

### Pipeline Chaining

Routes can apply multiple pipelines in sequence:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: web_security
    devices:
      - web_server_logs
    if: "event.category == 'web' && event.type == 'attack'"
    pipelines:
      - common_enrichment  # Applied first
      - attack_detection   # Applied second
      - threat_scoring     # Applied third
    targets:
      - security_elasticsearch
```

### Multi-Target Delivery

Routes can send processed data to multiple destinations:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: compliance_events
    if: "tags.contains('compliance')"
    pipelines:
      - name: compliance_formatting
    targets:
      - name: compliance_elasticsearch  # For searching and analytics
      - name: compliance_s3             # For long-term retention
      - name: auditor_webhook           # For real-time notification
```

### Fallback Routes

Routes without conditions act as catch-all handlers for unmatched events:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: primary_security
    if: "event.category == 'security'"
    targets:
      - name: security_elasticsearch
  
  - name: fallback_route
    # No if means this captures everything not matched above
    targets:
      - name: general_elasticsearch
```

### Advanced Configuration Patterns

* **Route Templates**: Use environment variables for flexible configurations:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: dynamic_routing
      if: "${ROUTING_CONDITION}"
      pipelines:
        - ${PRIMARY_PIPELINE}
        - ${SECONDARY_PIPELINE}
      targets:
        - ${TARGET_SYSTEM}
  ```

* **Conditional Targets**: Apply different targets based on event properties:

  ```yaml
  routes:
    - name: adaptive_routing
      pipelines:
        - name: event_classifier
        processors:
          - set:
            field: _route_target
            value: "{{ event.priority > 7 ? 'high_priority' : 'standard' }}"
      targets:      
        - script:
          source:|
            if (ctx._route_target == 'high_priority') {
              return ['urgent_elasticsearch', 'notification_system'];
            } else {
              return ['standard_elasticsearch'];
            }
  ```
