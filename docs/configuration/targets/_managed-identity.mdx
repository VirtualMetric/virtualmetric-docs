### Managed Identity Authentication

Azure targets support **Managed Identity** authentication for credential-free access when Director is deployed on Azure infrastructure.

**How it works**: When `tenant_id`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` are omitted from the configuration, the target automatically uses Azure's `DefaultAzureCredential`, which attempts authentication in the following order:

1. Environment variables (`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`)
2. Workload Identity (for Kubernetes deployments)
3. **Managed Identity** (system-assigned or user-assigned)
4. Azure CLI credentials
5. Azure PowerShell credentials

**Deployment requirement**: Director must run on Azure infrastructure that supports Managed Identity:
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure App Service
- Azure Container Instances
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Functions

**Required permissions**: The Managed Identity must be granted appropriate roles on the target Azure resource (e.g., `Storage Blob Data Contributor` for Blob Storage, `Azure Event Hubs Data Sender` for Event Hubs).

:::note
Managed Identity eliminates credential management overhead and is the recommended authentication method for Azure-hosted Director deployments.
