# Licensing

All content in the VirtualMetric **DataStream** Content Hub is provided under the Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2), which governs the use, modification, and distribution of pipeline templates, processors, and associated documentation.

## Elastic License 2.0 Overview

### License Framework

The Elastic License 2.0 provides a balanced approach to open source licensing that allows broad usage while maintaining certain restrictions on competitive use.

Permitted uses include using templates and content for internal data processing and analytics, modifying and customizing templates for organizational requirements, deploying in production environments for business operations, sharing modifications within your organization, and using templates for evaluation, development, and testing purposes.

License restrictions prohibit providing **DataStream** Content Hub templates as a managed service to third parties, offering competing data processing services using VirtualMetric content, redistributing Content Hub templates as part of competing commercial offerings, and removing or modifying license notices and attribution.

:::warning
Content Hub templates cannot be offered as a managed service or included in competing commercial products. All license notices and attribution must be retained.
:::

### Content Licensing Structure

Each template in the Content Hub includes comprehensive licensing information.

License documentation consists of complete Elastic License 2.0 text embedded in template metadata, attribution requirements and copyright notices, usage guidelines and restriction explanations, and contact information for licensing questions.

Template metadata includes license version and effective date, copyright holder identification (VirtualMetric), template version and creation date, and licensing terms specific to template dependencies.

## License Compliance

### Usage Requirements

All Content Hub templates must retain original licensing and attribution information.

Required elements include the Elastic License 2.0 copyright notice, VirtualMetric attribution and trademark notices, template creation and modification timestamps, and licensing terms documentation.

Compliance verification includes automated license compliance checking during template installation, documentation generation for audit and compliance reporting, license violation detection and reporting mechanisms, and integration with enterprise compliance management systems.

### Modification and Customization

Users may freely modify installed templates for internal use.

Allowed customizations include field mapping and transformation rule modifications, processing logic enhancement and optimization, integration with proprietary systems and workflows, and performance tuning and resource optimization.

Modification requirements include maintaining original license notices in modified templates, documenting modification history and authorship, preserving attribution to VirtualMetric for original content, and including licensing information in derivative works.

### Distribution and Sharing

Organizations may freely use and share templates within their legal entity.

Permitted internal activities include deployment across multiple business units and subsidiaries, sharing with contractors and authorized third parties, use in development, testing, and production environments, and integration with existing data processing infrastructure.

External distribution restrictions prohibit redistributing templates as standalone products, including templates in competing commercial data processing services, offering managed services based on VirtualMetric content, and removing licensing restrictions for external distribution.

## Enterprise Licensing

### Commercial Use Guidelines

The Elastic License 2.0 permits broad commercial use for internal business operations.

Approved commercial activities include production data processing for business analytics and reporting, security monitoring and incident response operations, compliance reporting and regulatory requirement fulfillment, and integration with enterprise security and operations platforms.

Service provider restrictions prohibit offering **DataStream** Content Hub templates as Software-as-a-Service, providing managed data processing services using VirtualMetric content, creating competing products incorporating Content Hub templates, and offering consulting services that primarily redistribute VirtualMetric content.

### Multi-Tenant and Cloud Deployments

Templates may be used in various cloud deployment scenarios.

Permitted cloud uses include private cloud deployments for organizational use, multi-tenant deployments serving a single organization, hybrid cloud integration with on-premises systems, and container and orchestration platform deployment.

Restriction considerations apply to public cloud services offering competing functionality, which may face restrictions. Multi-tenant services serving external customers require careful license review, and managed service providers should consult legal counsel for compliance guidance.

:::note
Managed service providers and organizations with complex multi-tenant deployments should consult legal counsel to ensure compliance with Elastic License 2.0 terms.
