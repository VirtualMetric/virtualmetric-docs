# Content Hub: Overview

The Content Hub provides a centralized repository of professionally-developed pipeline templates designed to accelerate **DataStream** deployment and standardize data processing workflows. These templates contain pre-built parsing, transformation, and enrichment logic for popular security devices, network equipment, and enterprise applications.

## Template Library

### Professional Template Development

All templates in the Content Hub are developed and maintained by VirtualMetric's engineering team.

Quality assurance processes include rigorous testing across multiple device firmware versions, validation against real-world log samples and edge cases, performance optimization for high-volume data processing, and regular updates to support new device features and log formats.

Templates maintain industry standards compliance through support for multiple security schemas (ASIM, OCSF, ECS, CIM, UDM), consistent field mapping and normalization across vendors, integration with popular SIEM and analytics platforms, and compliance with regulatory and audit requirements.

Comprehensive coverage includes support for major security vendors (Palo Alto, Cisco, Fortinet, Check Point), network infrastructure devices (switches, routers, load balancers), cloud platform integrations (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud), and enterprise applications and databases.

### Template Categories

Security device templates cover firewall logs with advanced threat detection parsing, intrusion detection and prevention system events, endpoint protection and antivirus solutions, and network access control and authentication systems.

Infrastructure templates handle network device logs and SNMP data processing, server operating system event collection, application performance and error log analysis, and database audit and transaction log processing.

Cloud platform templates address cloud service activity and audit log processing, container and orchestration platform monitoring, serverless function execution and error tracking, and cloud security and compliance event analysis.

## Interface Navigation

### Content Discovery

The Content Hub interface provides multiple ways to discover relevant templates through search and filtering capabilities.

The search functionality includes a global search field for template name and description matching, real-time search results with highlighting of matching terms, and search history with suggested queries for common use cases.

Available filter categories include:
- **Device Type** (single-select): Filter by device category (firewall, router, server, etc.)
- **Target** (multi-select): Filter by supported destination platforms (Sentinel, Splunk, etc.)
- **Device Vendor** (multi-select): Filter by manufacturer (Cisco, Palo Alto, Microsoft, etc.)

Filter behavior provides visual feedback with highlighting and count indicators for filter selections. Dynamic count updates show template matches for each filter option, and clear filter removal options maintain visual selection states.

### Template Cards

Each template card provides essential information for evaluation including template name and version information, supported device types and vendor compatibility, target platform integration capabilities, and installation status indicator (Available/Installed).

Visual indicators include a blue <gui>Installed</gui> badge displayed for already-installed templates, icon representations for device types and target platforms, template complexity indicators (Simple/Advanced/Enterprise), and last update timestamps with version history.

### Template Details

Clicking on any template card opens detailed documentation across four specialized views.

#### General Overview Tab

Template metadata includes complete template description and use case documentation, supported device models and firmware versions, prerequisites and dependency requirements, and installation and configuration guidance.

Technical specifications cover supported log formats and parsing capabilities, output schema and field mapping documentation, performance characteristics and resource requirements, and the integration compatibility matrix.

Processor documentation provides a complete list of processing components used in the template, individual processor documentation with configuration examples, links to detailed processor reference documentation, and recommendations for customization.

#### Pipeline Overview Tab

Pipeline architecture displays a visual representation of data processing flow, parent and child pipeline relationships, and processing stage documentation with dependencies.

The read-only pipeline view shows complete YAML configuration display with syntax highlighting and structure visualization, processing logic explanation and comments, and child pipeline navigation with cross-references.

#### Log Transformation Overview Tab

Sample data processing demonstrates real-world log samples showing input data format, step-by-step transformation process demonstration, and final output format with field mapping examples.

The before and after comparison shows raw log data in original format, processed output with normalized fields, schema compliance validation results, and performance metrics with processing statistics.

#### License Details Tab

Template licensing information includes complete license text for the specific template, Elastic License 2.0 terms and conditions, copyright notices and attribution requirements, and usage restrictions with compliance guidelines.

The read-only display shows full license text in code editor format, detailed terms specific to the template version, and reference to general licensing framework documentation.

## Template Installation Process

### Template Actions

Template detail pages provide different actions based on installation status.

For uninstalled templates, the <gui>Install Template</gui> button is available in the header. Clicking triggers a dependency check and installation process.

:::note
Template installation requires PIPELINE_CREATE permission.
:::

For installed templates, an <gui>Installed</gui> badge (blue tag) is displayed next to the template name. The <gui>Actions</gui> menu provides management operations including <gui>Manage Dependencies</gui> to update optional and required dependencies (only shown if dependencies exist), and <gui>See Installed Pipeline</gui> to navigate to the installed pipeline detail page.

### Installation Workflow

Before installation, users can thoroughly evaluate templates through the detail view tabs. Preview capabilities include complete pipeline logic review without installation, sample data transformation testing, license terms review, and resource requirement estimation.

### Dependency Management

When installing a template with dependencies, a modal appears for dependency selection.

Required dependencies include essential processing components that must be installed, core libraries and shared processing modules, and schema definitions and validation rules. A checkbox selection confirms installation, and already installed dependencies appear with an "Installed" indicator (disabled checkbox).

Optional dependencies include enhanced processing features and advanced transformations, integration modules for specific target platforms, and performance optimization components. These appear as user-selectable checkboxes for installation, with already installed dependencies indicated and disabled.

Dependency list features include <gui>Show More</gui> / <gui>Show Less</gui> buttons for lists exceeding 5 items, clickable dependency names to view dependency details, visual distinction between installed and available dependencies, and an installation progress indicator during processing.

For installed templates with dependencies, use the <gui>Manage Dependencies</gui> action to install additional optional dependencies, view currently installed required and optional dependencies, and update dependency selections for the installed template.

### Installation Completion

Upon successful template installation, a success toast message confirms the installation.

The user is automatically redirected to the installed pipeline detail page at the `/pipelines/{id}/general-overview` route, providing immediate access to pipeline configuration and customization.

After installation, the template remains visible in Content Hub with an <gui>Installed</gui> badge. The template detail page provides access to the installed pipeline via the <gui>See Installed Pipeline</gui> action, and full pipeline editing capabilities are available in the Pipeline management section.

## Post-Installation Management

### Template Integration

Once installed, templates become fully integrated into the **DataStream** platform.

Customization capabilities include full editing access to installed pipeline configurations, custom field mapping and transformation rule modification, integration with existing processing workflows, and child pipeline creation and management.

Status tracking provides installation status indicators throughout the Content Hub interface, version tracking and update notification system, usage statistics and performance monitoring, and change history with configuration audit trails.

## Template Updates

When Content Hub templates are updated by VirtualMetric, installed pipelines can receive these updates while preserving custom modifications through a merge workflow.

:::tip
Template updates preserve your customizations. The merge workflow lets you review changes and decide which updates to accept while keeping organization-specific modifications intact.
:::

### Update Notification System

Installed templates with available updates display visual indicators throughout the platform.

In the pipeline overview, a renew icon (circular arrow) is displayed on pipeline cards. Hovering over the icon shows an "Update available" tooltip. Clicking the card navigates to the pipeline detail view.

In the pipeline detail view, a yellow warning alert banner is displayed at the top of the page content with an "Update available" title and explanation that the template source has updates. The <gui>Review Update</gui> action button provides access to the update review interface, and the <gui>Review Update</gui> option is also available in the pipeline actions menu.

### Review Update Interface

Navigate to update review through multiple entry points:
- Click <gui>Review Update</gui> action button on warning alert banner
- Select <gui>Review Update</gui> from pipeline <gui>Actions</gui> menu
- Click renew icon on pipeline overview card (redirects to detail, then review)

The review update page is structured with two panels.

The left panel contains the pipeline tree with a resizable sidebar (adjustable width 292-600px). The main pipeline appears as the root with an update indicator if applicable. Child pipelines are nested with individual update indicators. Renew icons are displayed on tree items with available updates. Click tree items to view specific pipeline changes, and the selected pipeline is highlighted in the tree.

The right panel contains the merge editor with a side-by-side diff view showing original vs updated YAML comparison. Syntax highlighting provides YAML color coding for readability, and line-by-line changes show visual indicators for additions, deletions, and modifications. The original content (left) is read-only, while the modified content (right) is editable. Manual editing allows modification of the updated version before accepting. The editor respects the user's light/dark theme preference.

### Update Application Workflow

To review and apply changes:

1. **Select Pipeline** - Click a pipeline or child pipeline in the tree navigation to view changes for that specific component. Navigate between multiple pipelines with updates as needed.

2. **Examine Differences** - Review the side-by-side comparison of changes, identify new features, modifications, and removals, and understand the impact of template updates.

3. **Customize Updates** - Edit the right-side (modified) content as needed to merge custom configurations with template updates. Preserve organization-specific modifications and adjust updated content before application.

4. **Accept Changes** - Click the <gui>Accept Changes</gui> button to apply updates. A success notification confirms the update application, the pipeline refreshes with updated content, and the process repeats for additional pipelines with updates.

When all pipeline updates are applied, a blue info notification banner confirms "All updates installed" and indicates no pending updates. A button allows navigation back to the pipeline detail view, and renew icons are removed from overview cards.

### Update Scenarios

For individual pipeline updates, the main pipeline has an update while child pipelines remain unchanged. The update only affects root pipeline content, and child pipelines remain on their current version.

For child pipeline updates, one or more child pipelines have updates while the main pipeline may or may not have updates. Each child pipeline is reviewed and updated independently.

For complete template updates, the main pipeline and all child pipelines have updates. Navigate through the tree reviewing each component and apply updates systematically across the entire template structure.

For partial updates, accept some pipeline updates and skip others. The Review Update interface remains accessible to return later and apply remaining updates, providing flexibility for staged rollout of template changes.

The Content Hub accelerates **DataStream** deployment by providing professionally-developed, tested, and maintained pipeline templates that can be quickly installed and customized for specific organizational requirements.
