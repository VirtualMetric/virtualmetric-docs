# Director Overview

**Director** is a tool designed for creating and managing _pipelines_ in tandem to monitor telemetry data streams for various purposes, and **Generator** is a utility program intended to generate realistic telemetry data to help configure **Director** for production.

The pipelines are created to route incoming data streams from _sources_ to _targeted_ outgoing streams or some final destination.

The sources can be devices, networks, or pipelines, and the targets can be the **CLI**, log files, or again other pipelines. Sources and targets can be connected to each other in _one-to-one_, _one-to-many_, _many-to-one_, and _many-to-many_ configurations.

Each incoming stream can be queried with criteria specific to the properties of the data, and each outgoing stream can be enriched with inferences made from the data for further processing on the target side.

In this guide, we will explain various features: the types of devices, data files, and pipelines that can be specified; the types of data streams that can be handled; and the enrichment capabilities available in detail.
