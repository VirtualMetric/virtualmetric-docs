# VirtualMetric DataStream

VirtualMetric DataStream is an intelligent automation engine that streamlines data collection and routing for Microsoft Sentinel and other Azure data services. At its core, DataStream uses telemetry pipelines to efficiently process, enrich, and direct data flows to their optimal destinations.

DataStream simplifies Microsoft Sentinel deployment while providing the flexibility to route different types of data to the most appropriate Azure service based on cost and functionality requirements.

## What is a Telemetry Pipeline?

A telemetry pipeline is a comprehensive data processing system that manages the entire journey of log data from source to destination.
This system is responsible of collecting, processing, and routing data to various endpoints, ensuring that the right information reaches the right destination at the right time.

User can define the pipeline to route data to different destinations based on the data type, source, or other criteria to make sure that the data is handled efficiently and effectively.
Each piece of information that enters the pipeline undergoes several crucial transformations:

### Collection
The pipeline first gathers raw data from various sources like:
   - Network devices and firewalls
   - Operating systems and applications
   - Security tools and monitoring systems
   - Cloud services and infrastructure

### Processing
The pipeline then processes the data to ensure consistency and quality:
   - Data normalization to standardize formats
   - Parsing unstructured data into structured fields
   - Validation to ensure data quality and completeness
   - Enrichment with additional context and metadata

### Routing
The pipeline directs the data to the appropriate destinations based on its type and purpose:
   - Determining the appropriate destination based on data type
   - Managing data flow rates and batching
   - Ensuring delivery to the correct endpoints

<br />
:::note 
In enterprise environments, these pipelines are essential because they:
- Handle massive volumes of data efficiently
- Ensure consistent processing and formatting
- Maintain data integrity throughout the journey
- Enable real-time data flow management
- Support complex routing decisions

## Intelligent Log Routing

One of the challenges organizations face is managing the diverse types of log data generated by their systems and applications. This data must be directed to the appropriate destinations for security monitoring, threat detection, compliance, and analysis.

DataStream's routing capabilities enable organizations to direct different types of log data to the most appropriate Azure services based on their security, operational, and compliance requirements:

### Security-Related Logs
These logs contain critical security events that require real-time monitoring and immediate alerting. DataStream routes these logs directly to Microsoft Sentinel for threat detection and incident response.

### Threat Hunting Data
Historical security data is essential for threat hunting, incident investigation, and long-term trend analysis. DataStream routes this data to Azure Data Explorer for efficient querying and analysis.

### Compliance and Audit Logs
Regulatory compliance data must be stored securely for long-term retention and audit purposes. DataStream routes these logs to Azure Blob Storage for cost-effective storage and comprehensive audit trails.

This intelligent routing approach provides several benefits:
- Optimizes costs by using appropriate storage solutions
- Improves query performance for different use cases
- Enables flexible retention policies
- Maintains comprehensive security coverage
