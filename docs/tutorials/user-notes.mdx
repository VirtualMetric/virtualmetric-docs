# Tutorials: User Notes

This guide contains demonstrations of various uses of **DataStream** applications.

## Organization

The tutorials are structured with the same subsections to facilitate ease-of-use and learning.

### Working Directory

You can place your configuration files anywhere under the `config` folder.

:::note
By default, the tutorials will assume the configuration files are placed under a dedicated place which we will refer to as our _working directory_. For convenience, we suggest that you create and use the same folder.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
    ```PowerShell
    New-Item -Path <vm_root>\config\Tutorials -ItemType Folder
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    ```bash
    mkdir <vm_root>/config/Tutorials
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

Store all YAML configuration files within this subdirectory to maintain organization and avoid conflicts with production configurations.

### Sample Data

The tutorials frequently make use of sample data which are be provided as downloads. Make sure you place them in an accessible directory.

:::note
By default, the tutorials will use the following directory to access the sample data. For convenience, we suggest that you create the same directory with the same path and download the sample data files to that directory.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
    ```PowerShell
    New-Item -Path <vm_root>\SampleData -ItemType Folder
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
    ```bash
    mkdir <vm_root>/SampleData
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
