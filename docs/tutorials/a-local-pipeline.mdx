# A Local Pipeline

## Synopsis

This tutorial walks through the process of creating, validating, and testing a **DataStream** pipeline using the CSV processor.

## Scenario

Define a pipeline configuration that will 

- parse a prepared CSV test data, and
- output the extracted fields in JSON format.

Validation and testing of the pipeline will be done via **Director**'s _pipeline_ mode.

## Setup and Trial

First, create a file named `csv-consumer.yml` in our `config` directory. You will use this file to define your pipeline.

### Step 1: Define Your Pipeline Configuration

Create a YAML configuration file that defines your pipeline structure and processors:

```yaml title="csv-consumer.yml"
pipelines:
  name: csv_processing_pipeline
  description: "Process CSV data from log entries"
  processors:
    - csv:
        field: "message"
        target_fields: ["timestamp", "level", "component", "details"]
        separator: ","
        trim: true
        empty_value: "unknown"
        ignore_failure: false    
    - set:
        field: "processed_at"
        value: "{{ now() }}"
```

Copy this configuration to the file, and save it.

### Step 2: Prepare Test Data

Create sample input data to use for validating your pipeline. To do this, create a file named `test-data.json` and place it in our working directory:

```json title="test-data.json"
{
  "message": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z,INFO,auth-service,User login successful",
  "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Step 3: Validate Pipeline Syntax

Use **Director** to make sure that:

- There are no syntax errors [✓]
- Pipeline configuration is valid [✓]
- All processors are correctly configured [✓]

```bash
vmetric-director -pipeline -path csv-consumer.yml -validate
```

:::info
The validator checks for syntactic correctness, required field presence, reference integrity, and logical consistency.
:::

### Step 4: Test Pipeline Processing

Run your pipeline in test mode with sample data:

```bash
vmetric-director -pipeline -path csv-consumer.yml -input test-data.json -test
```

### Step 5: Verify Output

Check that your pipeline produces the following expected output:

```json
{
  "message": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z,INFO,auth-service,User login successful",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "component": "auth-service",
  "details": "User login successful",
  "processed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:15.123Z",
  "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
