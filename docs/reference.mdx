## ASIM

**ASIM** (Advanced Security Information Model) is a layer between the data and the user to configure what and how to ingest data from the source and to route it to a destination.

For details, see [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/normalization) on the Microsoft site.

Available ASIM tables:

- ASimAuditEventLogs
- ASimAuthenticationEventLogs
- ASimDhcpEventLogs
- ASimDnsActivityLogs
- ASimFileEventLogs
- ASimNetworkSessionLogs
- ASimProcessEventLogs
- ASimRegistryEventLogs
- ASimUserManagementActivityLogs

## Parquet Files

The parquet file was designed by Apache as a column-based format. Unlike row-based formats like **CSV**, it stores the records in columns.

**Row-based storage** First row contains field names:

```plaintext
id,name,last_name,age
1,John,Buck,35
2,Jane,Doe,27
3,Joe,Dane,42
```

**Column-based Storage** First column contains field names:

```plaintext
id:1,2,3
name:John,Jane,Joe
last_name:Buck,Doe,Dane
age:35, 27,42
```

Parquet files use _dictionary encoding_, compression and _bit packing_, and _run-length encoding_, features which make it more efficient compared to row-based formats.

## PEM Files

A **PEM** (Privacy Enhanced Mail) file is a container format often used to store cryptographic keys, certificates, and other data. It is a base64-encoded file that starts with a header and ends with a footer, e.g.:

```encoding
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIH/TCCBeWgAwIBAgIQaBYE3/M08XHYCnNVmcFBcjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBy
MQswCQYDVQQGEwJVUzEOMAwGA1UECAwFVGV4YXMxEDAOBgNVBAcMB0hvdXN0b24x
ETAPBgNVBAoMCFNTTCBDb3JwMS4wLAYDVQQDDCVTU0wuY29tIEVWIFNTTCBJbnRl
cm1lZGlhdGUgQ0EgUlNBIFIzMB4XDTIwMDQwMTAwNTgzM1oXDTIxMDcxNjAwNTgz
M1owgb0xCzAJBgNVBAYTAlVTMQ4wDAYDVQQIDAVUZXhhczEQMA4GA1UEBwwHSG91
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

where `CERTIFICATE` can also be `PRIVATE KEY` or `RSA KEY`. These blocks communicate what is encoded in the file.

This is a text-based format, and the base64-encoded data can be uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, '+', and '/'.

A **PEM** file can contain multiple blocks of such data. These are generally used to encode for example **RSA** keys for **SSH** connections, certificates used for **SSL** encryption and the keys associated with them, etc.

A **PEM** file for certificates can specify

* the end-user certificate assigned to a domain name by a **CA** (Certificate Authority)
* up to 4 intermedidate certificates
* a root certificate self-signed by the **CA**

These are generally issued by the **SSL** provider to be used in a web service.

**PEM** files are also used for **SSH**. Typical use on the command line is:

```CLI-linux
ssh -i keyfile.pem root@host
```

where the `-i` parameter specifies the PEM file to use to create a secure **SSH** connection `host`.

## Syslog

**SYSLOG** is a standard protocol used for system logging in computer networks. Using this protocol, devices and applications send log messages to central servers that store them for monitoring and analysis.

### Severity

**Syslog** has numeric severity levels, indicating their importance. The lower the value, the more critical the event. The levels are used for:

* _Prioritization_ of critical issues
* _Filtering_ of log messages
* _Automation_ of specific types of events
* _Compliance_ with regulatory standards

|Level|Severity|Description|
|---|---|---|
|0|Emergency|System unusable|
|1|Alert|Immediate action required|
|2|Critical|Condition critical|
|3|Error|Errors exist|
|4|Warning|Warnings exist|
|5|Notice|Significant condition|
|6|Info|Info messages|
|7|Debug|Debug messages|
