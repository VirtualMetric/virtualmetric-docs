<dd>A standardized schema for security events used by Microsoft Sentinel, focusing on normalized field names in PascalCase format.</dd>

<dt>**Audit**</dt>
<dd>Review of logs for the purpose of verifying that IT policies are correctly implemented.</dd>

<dt>**Access Control**</dt>
<dd>A security mechanism that regulates who or what can view, use, or modify resources in a computing environment based on predefined policies and permissions.</dd>

<dt>**Authentication**</dt>
<dd>The process of verifying the identity of users, devices, or systems attempting to access resources.</dd>

## B

<dt>**Batch Processing**</dt>
<dd>Collective sequential processing of a large number of records that require the same operations.</dd>

<dt>**Buffer Management**</dt>
<dd>Control of memory buffers used for temporary data storage during processing, including size control and flush intervals.</dd>

## C

<dt>**CEF (Common Event Format)**</dt>
<dd>A standardized log format used by security information and event management (SIEM) systems.</dd>

<dt>**CIM (Common Information Model)**</dt>
<dd>Splunk's data normalization schema using underscore-based field names.</dd>

<dt>**Connection Pooling**</dt>
<dd>Maintaining a cache of database connections that can be reused when future requests to the database are required, reducing the overhead of creating new database connections for each request.</dd>

<dt>**Checkpoint Recovery**</dt>
<dd>Using periodic snapshots (checkpoints) of the database state to restore system consistency after a failure by only needing to replay transactions that occurred after the most recent checkpoint.</dd>

## D

<dt>**Data Collection Rules (DCR)**</dt>
<dd>Configuration settings that define how data should be collected and processed in Azure Monitor.</dd>

<dt>**Data Enrichment**</dt>
<dd>The process of enhancing data with additional context or information from external sources.</dd>

<dt>**Data Partitioning**</dt>
<dd>Dividing a large dataset into smaller, more manageable sections. Frequently used in parallel computing and distributed systems to improve performance and scalability.</dd>

<dt>**Device**</dt>
<dd>A source of log data, which can be physical hardware, virtual machines, or software components.</dd>

## E

<dt>**ECS (Elastic Common Schema)**</dt>
<dd>Elastic's standardized schema for log data using dot notation field names.</dd>

<dt>**Event**</dt>
<dd>Any occurrence in a computerized and networked system that registers as a sender or receiver of signals.</dd>

<dt>**eStreamer**</dt>
<dd>Cisco's event streaming protocol used by Firepower Management Center to send events to external clients.</dd>

## F

<dt>**Field Mapping**</dt>
<dd>The process of translating field names from one format to another during data normalization.</dd>

<dd>A sequence of related packets in network traffic, typically representing a single connection or transaction.</dd>

## G

<dt>**Geohash**</dt>
<dd>A system for encoding geographic locations into short strings of letters and numbers.</dd>

<dt>**Geotile**</dt>
<dd>A method of dividing geographic areas into tiles based on zoom levels and coordinates.</dd>

## I
