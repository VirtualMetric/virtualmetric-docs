# Glossary

## A

<dt>**Audit**</dt>
<dd>Review of logs for the purpose of verifying that IT policies are correctly implemented.</dd>

<dt>**Access Control**</dt>
<dd>A security mechanism that regulates who or what can view, use, or modify resources in a computing environment based on predefined policies and permissions.</dd>

## B

<dt>**Batch Processing**</dt>
<dd>Collective sequential processing of a large number of records that require the same operations.</dd>

## C

<dt>**Connection Pooling**</dt>
<dd>Maintaining a cache of database connections that can be reused when future requests to the database are required, reducing the overhead of creating new database connections for each request.</dd>

<dt>**Checkpoint Recovery**</dt>
<dd>Using periodic snapshots (checkpoints) of the database state to restore system consistency after a failure by only needing to replay transactions that occurred after the most recent checkpoint.</dd>

## D

<dt>**Data Partitioning**</dt>
<dd>Dividing a large dataset into smaller, more manageable sections. Frequently used in parallel computing and distributed systems to improve performance and scalability.</dd>

## E

<dt>**Event**</dt>
<dd>Any occurence in a computerized and networked system that registers as a sender or receiver of signals.</dd>

## I

<dt>**Ingestion**</dt>
<dd>Collection of data from a source for a specific purpose of use such analysis or monitoring.</dd>

## M

<dt>**Management**</dt>
<dd>The policy implemented to handle log lines after they have been processed.</dd>

## N

<dt>**Normalization**</dt>
<dd>The process of transforming data formats with the intention of rendering them more suitable for use by a consumer.</dd>

## P

<dt>**Pipeline**</dt>
<dd>Pre-configured processing logic for a data stream.</dd>

<dt>**Processor**</dt>
<dd>A component that performs a specific operation on streaming data.</dd>

## R

<dt>**Routing**</dt>
<dd>Sending or directing a data stream to a destination for further processing or analysis.</dd>

## S

<dt>**Supervisor**</dt>
<dd>The component that checks the health of the processes. It restarts stopped services, cleans up the `temp` folder, etc.</dd>

<dt>**Schema Evolution**</dt>
<dd>Gradual change over time of the layout and structure of data underlying a processing system.</dd>

<dt>**Size-Based Rotation**</dt>
<dd>The practice of automatically creating new log/data files when the current file reaches a specified size limit, helping to manage storage and prevent individual files from becoming too large to handle efficiently.</dd>

<dt>**Schema Validation**</dt>
<dd>The process of verifying that data conforms to a predefined structure, format, and rules (schema) before it is processed or stored in a system.</dd>

## T

<dt>**Template**</dt>
<dd>Container object with selection and/or processing logic for incoming data stream.</dd>

## V

<dt>**Vectorized Processing**</dt>
<dd>Using all available cores in a system to load balance the processing operation.</dd>
