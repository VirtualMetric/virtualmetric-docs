# Overview

**VirtualMetric Director** is a tool for creating **pipelines** to monitor telemetry data streams.

The pipelines are created to route incoming data streams from the _source_ to a _targeted_ outgoing stream or a final destination.

The sources can be devices, networks, or pipelines, and the targets can be the **CLI**, files, or again other pipelines. Sources and targets can be routed to each other in _one-to-one_, _one-to-many_, _many-to-one_, and _many-to-many_ configurations.

Each incoming stream can be queried with criteria specific to the properties of the data, and each outgoing stream can be enriched with inferences made from the data for further processing on the target side.
