# Overview

**VirtualMetric Director** is a tool for creating **routing pipelines** between sources and targets to monitor telemetry data streams. The sources can be devices, networks, or pipelines, and the targets can be the **CLI**, files, or again other pipelines. Sources and targets can be connected in one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many configurations. Each incoming stream can be queried using specific criteria, and each outgoing stream can be enriched with inferences for further processing on the target side.
