# Components

VirtualMetric DataStream is a comprehensive telemetry pipeline solution that simplifies data collection, processing, and routing for Microsoft Sentinel and other Azure data services. At its core, DataStream uses telemetry pipelines to efficiently process, enrich, and direct data flows to their optimal destinations.
VirtualMetric DataStream is composed of the following components:

## VirtualMetric Director ##

**VirtualMetric Director&trade;** is a telemetry tool designed for listening on various data sources, extracting and transforming them, and routing them to destinations. This powerful component acts as the central nervous system of your data pipeline, orchestrating the flow of telemetry data across your entire infrastructure.

Director provides a unified interface for managing multiple data sources and destinations, enabling seamless data collection, transformation, and distribution. Its architecture is built to handle enterprise-scale data volumes while maintaining high performance and reliability.

Key capabilities of Director include:

### Source Management
  * Multiple protocol support (TCP, UDP, HTTP)
  * File system monitoring
  * Database change tracking
  * API integration
  * Custom source implementations

### Data Transformation
  * Real-time data processing
  * Format conversion
  * Field extraction
  * Data enrichment
  * Custom transformation rules

### Intelligent Routing
  * Dynamic destination selection
  * Load balancing
  * Failover handling
  * Priority-based routing
  * Conditional routing logic

### Monitoring and Control
  * Real-time pipeline visibility
