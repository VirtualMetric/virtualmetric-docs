# Deployment: Overview

DataStream offers flexible deployment options to match your specific infrastructure requirements. Whether you're running on local hardware, cloud virtual machines, or managed services, DataStream can be deployed in a way that optimizes performance and minimizes operational overhead.

## Deployment Models

DataStream supports the following deployment models:

| Deployment Type | Description | Use Case |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Local** | Run DataStream on your own hardware | Development, testing, or small-scale deployments |
| **Azure VM** | Deploy on Azure Virtual Machines | Production workloads with custom configurations |
| **Azure App Service** | Run as a managed service | Simplified operations with automatic scaling |
| **Azure Functions** | Event-driven serverless deployment | Cost-effective processing of intermittent workloads |
| **Azure Arc Extension** | Deploy to hybrid or multi-cloud environments | Consistent management across diverse infrastructure |

## Deployment Prerequisites

Before deploying DataStream, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - CPU: 2+ cores (4+ recommended for production)
  - RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB+ recommended for production)
  - Storage: 20GB minimum for the application

- **Software Requirements**:
  - Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, RHEL 8+), Windows Server 2019+
  - .NET Runtime: 6.0 or later

- **Network Requirements**:
  - Inbound ports: Based on configured collectors (e.g., 514 for Syslog)
  - Outbound connectivity to your storage and analytics services

## Choosing the Right Deployment Model

Consider these factors when selecting a deployment option:

1. **Data Volume**: Higher volumes may require VM-based deployments for maximum performance
2. **Operational Overhead**: Managed services reduce maintenance but may have configuration limitations
3. **Cost Model**: Serverless options can be cost-effective for variable workloads
4. **Integration Requirements**: Some deployment options offer better integration with existing systems
5. **Security Requirements**: Different deployment models have different security boundaries

## Deployment Process Overview

Regardless of the deployment model, the general process follows these steps:

1. **Prepare Environment**: Set up the target infrastructure and dependencies
2. **Configure DataStream**: Define collectors, pipelines, and output destinations
3. **Deploy Application**: Install DataStream using the appropriate method
4. **Verify Operation**: Check logs and metrics to ensure proper functioning
5. **Monitor and Scale**: Adjust resources based on actual usage patterns
