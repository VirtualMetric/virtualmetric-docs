# Autodiscovery

**VirtualMetric Director** provides an autodiscovery feature for **Microsoft Sentinel** integration. This enables automatic detection and configuration of _Data Collection Rules_ (DCRs) and their associated streams, simplifying the setup process and providing dynamic updates as your Sentinel environment changes.

**VirtualMetric**'s **Sentinel Automation** tool has the following prerequisites:

- an **Azure** subscription with permissions to create resources
- a _Log Analytics_ workspace required by **Microsoft Sentinel**

:::note
Autodiscovery is handled automatically if the **Automation** tool is used. You only need to complete the *Required Permissions* step if you're using the _Managed Identity_ option.
:::

Open a terminal with _Administrative_ access and navigate to `<vm_root>`. Then, type the following command and press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>.

<Tabs groupId="cli-options">
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
  ```PowerShell
  C:\<vm_root>\vmetric-director -sentinel -autodiscovery
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
  ```bash
  ~/path/to/<vm_root>: ./vmetric-director -sentinel -autodiscovery
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the setup process. For detailed step-by-step instructions, refer to our [Microsoft Sentinel Automation](/docs/architecture/microsoft-sentinel/index.mdx) documentation.

## Required Permissions

**Director** needs the following permissions to fetch the _Data Collection Rules_ and their associated streams.

:::note
If you used the **Automation** tool with _App Registration_, these permissions are already configured.
:::

### For Data Collection

For each DCR name prefixed with _vmetric_:

1. Navigate to the DCR in **Azure Portal**
2. Go to **Access Control (IAM)**
3. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment**
4. Assign the following permissions:
   |Role|Assignee|
   |---|---|
   |Monitoring Metrics Publisher|Your _Managed Identity_ or _Application_|

### For Autodiscovery

To enable the DCR autodiscovery features:

1. Navigate to the _Resource Group_ containing your DCRs
2. Go to **Access Control (IAM)**
3. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment**
4. Assign the following permissions:
   |Role|Assignee|
   |---|---|
   |Monitoring Reader|Your _Managed Identity_ or _Application_|

:::important
The `Monitoring Reader` role should be assigned at the _Resource Group_ level only. Assigning this role at the _Subscription_ level is **not recommended** since it is not required for the functionality to work, and it increases the autodiscovery scan duration.
:::

### Verification

After assigning the permissions:

1. Wait a few minutes for **Azure** RBAC to propagate
2. Test the connection using **Director**
3. Check the logs for any permission-related errors

:::tip
If you encounter permission issues, verify that all role assignments are properly configured, that **Azure** RBAC changes have propagated (can take up to 30 minutes), and that the identity has the correct access scope.
:::

## How It Works

### Resource ID-Based Discovery

Instead of manually configuring the _Data Collection Endpoint_ (DCE) URL, you can provide the _DCE Resource ID_. For example:

```text
/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionEndpoints/<dce-name>
```

When using a _Resource ID_, **Director** will discover all DCRs associated with the specified DCE, and collect detailed stream information including table names, table schemas (column definitions), and stream configurations.

### Caching Mechanism

The default cache duration is **5 minutes**. The cache is automatically invalidated when the configuration file (`sentinel.yml`) is modified or the cache timeout is reached.

### Dynamic Updates

The autodiscovery feature continuously adapts to changes in your **Sentinel** environment thanks to which new DCRs are automatically detected, and changes to table schemas are recognized while custom tables and columns are discovered and integrated.

## Phantom Field Prevention

**Microsoft Sentinel** has moved to DCR-based log ingestion and manual schema management. This change, while powerful, can lead to _phantom fields_, i.e. data fields that are ingested and billed even though they are not part of the table schema and therefore are inaccessible for querying, and yet are still incurring storage costs.

> For a comprehensive understanding of phantom fields, see [Sentinel Phantom Fields](https://www.managedsentinel.com/sentinel-phantom-fields/) by ManagedSentinel.

Among the common scenarios that cause these are log splitting with mismatched schemas, temporary fields in transformations, duplicate fields emerging from improper field mapping, and schema modifications without proper cleanup.

**Director**'s autodiscovery feature includes a built-in phantom field prevention mechanism based on the following:

**Schema Validation** - Automatically discovers table schemas from DCRs, validates each field against the known schema, and discards fields not present in the table schema.

**Dynamic Field Mapping** - Fields that exist in the schema or are required are kept while others are discarded.

**Cost Optimization** - Prevents unnecessary data ingestion thereby reducing storage costs while maintaining data accessibility.

The most salient reason for preventing phantom fields is to reduce their **impact on cost**. Some environments show up to 65% of table data as phantom fields.

The guiding principles here are:

* For _schema management_, regularly review table schemas, update schemas when adding new fields, use autodiscovery to validate field usage.

* For _field mapping_, let autodiscovery handle field validation, define critical fields explicitly when needed, and monitor for any dropped fields in logs.

* For _cost monitoring_, track ingestion volumes, monitor field usage patterns, and verify data accessibility.

A typical example:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: sentinel
    type: sentinel
    properties:
      tenant_id: "<your-tenant-id>"
      client_id: "<your-client-id>"
      client_secret: "<your-client-secret>"
      endpoint: "/subscriptions/...</dataCollectionEndpoints/<dce-name>"  # Use Resource ID instead of URL
```

You can filter the autodiscovered streams that you intend to use:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: sentinel
    type: sentinel
    properties:
      tenant_id: "<your-tenant-id>"
      client_id: "<your-client-id>"
      client_secret: "<your-client-secret>"
      endpoint: "/subscriptions/...</dataCollectionEndpoints/<dce-name>"
      streams:
        - name: "Custom-WindowsEvent"
        - name: "Custom-SecurityEvent"
```

You can optionally adjust the cache timeout (in seconds):

```yaml
targets:
  - name: sentinel
    type: sentinel
    properties:
      endpoint: "/subscriptions/...</dataCollectionEndpoints/<dce-name>"
      cache:
        timeout: 300
```
