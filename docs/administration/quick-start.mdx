# Administration: Quick Start

This guide will help you quickly set up and run **Director** for log collection and processing.

## Initial Setup

The basic system can be configured through a file named `vmetric.yaml`, which can be found in the `config` directory under the root, i.e. the folder where you have placed **Director**. This file contains the following fields:

```yaml title="<vm_root>/vmetric.yaml"
debug:
  log:
    status: true
  level: 5
  console:
    status: false
```

:::tip
Enable _console debugging_ by setting `console.status` to `true`.
:::

Note that _logging status_ is by default set to `true`. With these settings, **Director** is ready to be activated.

## The Devices

Configure the following devices using the settings given:

* **Syslog**

  ```yaml title="<vm_root>/config/devices/syslog.yaml"
  devices:
    - id: 324235346
      name: 127.0.0.1
      type: syslog
      status: true
      properties:
        address: "0.0.0.0"
        port: 14514
  ```

* **eStreamer**

  ```yaml title="<vm_root>/config/devices/estreamer.yaml"
  devices:
    - id: 456789
      name: firepower
      type: estreamer
      status: true
      properties:
        address: "192.168.1.10"
        port: 8302
  ```

* **TCP**

  ```yaml title="<vm_root>/config/devices/tcp.yaml"
  devices:
    - id: 567890
      name: tcp_collector
      type: tcp
      status: true
      properties:
        address: "0.0.0.0"
        port: 9000
  ```

## The Target

Configure the following target using the settings given:

* **Sentinel**

  ```yaml title="<vm_root>/config/targets/sentinel.yaml"
  targets:
    - id: 1
      name: microsoft_sentinel
      type: sentinel
      properties:
        workspace_id: "your-workspace-id"
        shared_key: "your-shared-key"
        log_type: "CustomLogs"
  ```

## The Pipeline

Now you will configure a pipeline using, again, a template.

1. First, locate the `package\defitinions/pipelines/checkpoint.yaml` template under `<vm_root>`
2. Copy this file to the `user/defitinions/pipelines` directory
3. Modify its settings as below:

  ```yaml title="user/definitions/pipelines/checkpoint.yaml"
  pipelines:
    - name: checkpoint
      processors:
        - parse_checkpoint:
            field: message
        - add_fields:
            fields:
              environment: production
  ```

:::tip
Always work with the files in the `user/definitions` directory. Templates in the `package/definitions` directory are overwritten between updates.
:::

## The Route

Configure a route using the settings given below:

```yaml title="config/routes/main.yaml"
routes:
  - name: checkpoint_to_sentinel
    if: device.type == 'syslog'
    pipelines:
      - checkpoint
    targets:
      - microsoft_sentinel
```

You have configured a pipeline that will read _Syslog_ and route the data to _Microsoft Sentinel_.
