# Managing Directors

To manage directors, go to **Home** > **Directors**. From the table presented, you can monitor the availability and status of directors, and perform various operations on them.

## Editing

To edit the details of a director,

- Click the **Actions** menu button (&#x22EE;) on the right of its row
- Select **Edit director**

This will take you to the first tab of the **Director Details** view.

:::note
The options found on the table row through the **Actions** menu button (&#x22EE;) are also available here from the **Actions** drop-down list on the top right.
:::

To start editing the details of the director, click the **Manage director details** button on the page.

- The editable field&mdash;on this page, only the name of the director&mdash;will be enabled, and the **Cancel** and **Save changes** buttons will appear.

On the **Connection Details** tab of the view, you can check the connection status of the director.

- If the director is not connected, the **Connection Status** will be red and will read _Not connected_.
- You can also see the IP address&mdash;_None_ if there is no connection, a specific IP address if there is one&mdash;and the connection history of the director.

If necessary, you can click the **Re-install director** button to reinstall the director.

:::warning
This action revokes the previously issued API key, and generates a new one.

You will see a confirmation modal stating that the current API key will be revoked. Clicking **Continue** takes you to **Connection Details**, where a new API key and installation script are shown. (See <Topic id="gui-creating-directors">the previous chapter</Topic> for installation steps.)

On the **Activity logs** tab of the view, you will find information on the activity of the director in table form. The table has the following columns:

- **User** - Email address of the user who performed the action
- **User IP** - IP address of the user at the time of the action
- **Object type** - By default, _Director_
- **Object** - The specific director (using the unique name given during creation)

- **Action Description** - detailed description of the activity
- **Date** - the date the action was performed

## Deleting
