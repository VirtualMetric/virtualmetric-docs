# Targets: Overview

This is where you manage all your data output destinations.

The main view displayes the target types you can use.

Currently available target types:

- <Topic id="targets-console">**Console**</Topic> targets output data directly for debugging and testing purposes.

- <Topic id="targets-file">**File**</Topic> targets write data to files in various formats (JSON, CSV, XML) with configurable rotation and compression.

- <Topic id="targets-microsoft-sentinel">**Microsoft Sentinel**</Topic> targets integrate with Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM platform for security analysis and monitoring.

- <Topic id="targets-azure-blob-storage">**Azure Blob Storage**</Topic> targets send data to Azure Blob Storage for archival and long-term storage.

- <Topic id="targets-azure-data-explorer">**Azure Data Explorer**</Topic> targets send data to **Azure Data Explorer** for real-time analytics.

Each target type card shows enabled/disabled counts.

Selecting one of the cards (e.g., _Console_) takes you to the configuration view.
