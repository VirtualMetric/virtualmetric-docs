# Managing Devices

To manage a device:

-or-

- From the hamburger menu on the top left, select **Fleet Management**&nbsp;>&nbsp;**Devices**

Then, on the **Devices** view, click on your push/pull device type's card.

This takes you to a configuration view with the following elements:

- On the left, a **sidebar** listing the same device types as the cards shown on the **Devices** view. The device type card you have clicked on will be selected with blue.
- On the right, the devices table displays all available devices of the selected type.

**Table controls:**
- **Search devices** - Text box to filter devices by name

- **Status** - Filter to select _All_, _Enabled_, or _Disabled_

The table displays the properties of the selected device type as columns. The listed devices will display the values assigned to its fields either initially at creation time or afterwards at editing time.

## Editing

The editing steps available differs based on the device's push/pull functionality, and the settings to be edited are device-specific.

To edit a device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row
- Select **Edit device details**

### Push Devices

## Cloning (Push devices only)

To create a copy of an existing device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row
- Select **Clone device**

:::note
Agents cannot be cloned since they're tied to specific systems.
:::

The cloned device inherits all settings but gets:

- A new unique name by prepending `Copy of` to the old name
- A new unique port (if port conflicts exist)
- Same director assignments (unless changed)

:::caution
Ensure port numbers are unique when cloning to avoid conflicts.
:::

## Status Change

To enable or disable a device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row
- Select **Enable device** or **Disable device**

:::note
The action menu shows "`Disable device`" for enabled devices and "`Enable device`" for disabled devices.
:::

Disabling a device stops data collection but preserves all configuration settings.

## Deleting

Before attempting to delete a device, make sure that it is not a dependency for any routes.

:::info
Devices that are part of route configurations cannot be deleted. They must be removed from those routes first.
:::

To remove a device:

- Click the **Actions** menu (&#x22EE;) on the device row  
- Select **Delete**
- Confirm the deletion in the modal prompt

:::warning
Device deletion is permanent and immediately stops all data flows from the device's source on that pipeline.
