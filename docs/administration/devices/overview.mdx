# Devices: Overview

VirtualMetric Director uses devices as abstraction layers to collect, process, and manage telemetry data from various sources. These devices serve as the interface between data sources and the Director's processing pipeline.

## Device Categories

### Operating System Monitoring

Director uses a unified agent-based approach with two deployment methods:

#### Managed Agent (Traditional)

- Agent installed and managed by system administrators
- Persistent installation on target systems
- Local data buffering during network issues
- Windows, Linux, MacOS, Solaris, AIX support

#### Auto-managed Agent (Agentless)

- Director automatically deploys and manages agent process
- No manual installation required
- Same capabilities as managed agent:
 - Local data buffering
 - Network resilience
 - Performance optimization
- Self-healing: Director automatically redeploys if process terminates
- Windows: WinRM for deployment
- Linux, MacOS, Solaris, AIX: SSH for deployment
- Supports remote credential management

Both approaches provide:

- Local data processing
- Store-and-forward during connectivity issues
- Real-time metrics and events
- Native OS monitoring capabilities

The key difference is deployment and lifecycle management, not functionality.

### Protocol Listeners

Director can receive data through various network protocols:

#### Push-based Protocols

Devices send data to Director:

- Syslog (UDP/TCP)
- SNMP Traps
- HTTP/HTTPS
- TCP/UDP streams
- eStreamer events

#### Pull-based Integration

Director fetches data from sources:

- Kafka topics
- Microsoft Sentinel
- REST APIs
- Database queries
- Custom integrations

## Data Processing

### Pipeline Processing

- Message parsing and enrichment with custom rules
- Data transformation (field mapping, type conversion)
- Event correlation and aggregation
- Custom field extraction and tagging
- Filter and routing based on message content
- Alert generation for matching conditions
- Templating support for output formatting
- Built-in and custom functions

### Queue Management

- Persistent message storage
- Configurable batch processing
- Automatic checkpoint recovery
- Queue rotation and cleanup

### Performance Features

- Multi-worker architecture
- Dynamic scaling
- Socket reuse optimization
- Buffer management
- Resource monitoring

### Security Controls

- Authentication methods
  - Basic auth
  - API keys
  - HMAC signing
  - Client certificates
- Encryption options
  - TLS/SSL
  - SNMPv3 privacy
  - Custom encryption
- Access control
- Audit logging

## Deployment Options

### Standalone
```
[Sources] → [Director]
```

### High Availability
```
[Sources] → [Load Balancer] → [Director Cluster]
```

or

```
[Sources] → [Director Cluster with VIP]
```

## Common Applications

### Infrastructure Monitoring

- System performance metrics
- Event logs
- Resource utilization
- Service availability

### Security Operations

- Security event collection
- Threat detection
- Compliance monitoring
- Audit trails

### Application Telemetry

- Application logs
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- User activity

### Network Monitoring

- Network device logs
- Traffic analysis
- SNMP data
- Connection tracking

## Configuration

All device configurations reside in the `config` directory using either `.yaml` or `.yml` extensions. Flexible organization options:

```
config/
├── devices/
│   ├── windows/
│   ├── linux/
│   └── network/
├── listeners/
└── integrations/
```

Director recursively discovers all configuration files regardless of subfolder structure.

:::note
Each device type provides specific configuration options detailed in their respective documentation.
:::

:::warning
Always implement the appropriate security controls when deploying devices, especially in production environments.
