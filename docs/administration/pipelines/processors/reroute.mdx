# Reroute

## Synopsis

```yaml {2}
reroute:
  - destination: <string>
  - description: <text>
  - if: <script>
  - ignore_failure: <boolean>
  - on_failure: <processor[]>
  - on_success: <processor[]>
  - tag: <string>
```

## Description

**Functionality**: Enables dynamic routing of logs to different target systems based on pipeline processing results.

The Reroute processor is a powerful feature that allows you to make routing decisions after processing your logs through pipelines. While basic routing can be configured at the source level, Reroute gives you the ability to:

- Route logs to different destinations based on the content extracted or modified by pipeline processors
- Implement complex routing logic that depends on multiple conditions or transformations
- Direct logs to specific target systems defined in your configuration

The `destination` field should reference a target system defined in your configuration (e.g., Sentinel, Splunk, etc.).

## Parameters

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`destination`|Y|-|Name of the target system configuration to route to|
|`description`|N|-|Explanatory note|
|`if`|N|-|Condition to run|
|`ignore_failure`|N|`false`|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`on_failure`|N|-|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`on_success`|N|-|See [Handling Success](../handling-success.mdx)|
|`tag`|N|-|Identifier|

## Examples

### Route to Microsoft Sentinel

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    First, define your Sentinel target configuration...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - id: 1
      name: auto_sentinel
      type: sentinel
      properties:
        tenant_id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        client_id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        client_secret: "your-client-secret"
        rule_id: "dcr-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        endpoint: "https://your-dcr-endpoint"
    ```
  </CodeCol>
  
  <CommentCol>
    Then use Reroute in your pipeline to send specific logs to Sentinel...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    pipelines:
      - name: security_pipeline
        processors:
          - grok:
              field: message
              pattern: '%{IPADDR:source_ip}'
          - reroute:
              if: 'source_ip matches "10.0.0.*"'
              destination: auto_sentinel
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Conditional Routing Based on Log Processing

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Process logs and route based on extracted data...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    pipelines:
      - name: firewall_logs
        processors:
          - checkpoint:
              field: message
          - reroute:
              if: 'checkpoint.action == "Drop" && checkpoint.severity >= 3'
              destination: high_priority_sentinel
          - reroute:
              destination: standard_sentinel
    ```
  </CodeCol>
  <CommentCol>
    using different target configurations:
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    - id: 1
      name: high_priority_sentinel
      type: sentinel
      properties:
        tenant_id: "tenant1"
        # ... high priority config
        
    - id: 2
      name: standard_sentinel
      type: sentinel
      properties:
        tenant_id: "tenant2"
        # ... standard config
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Multi-Stage Processing and Routing

<ExampleGrid>
  <CommentCol>
    Process logs through multiple stages before routing...
  </CommentCol>
  <CodeCol>
    ```yaml
    pipelines:
      - name: complex_processing
        processors:
          - json:
              field: message
          - grok:
              field: parsed_message
              pattern: '%{DATA:app_name}'
          - user_agent:
              field: user_agent
          - geoip:
              field: ip_address
          - reroute:
              if: 'geoip.country_code not in ["US", "CA"] && app_name == "core_banking"'
              destination: security_analytics
          - reroute:
              destination: standard_logs
    ```
  </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

:::note
The Reroute processor allows you to leverage the full power of your pipeline processing to make intelligent routing decisions. You can process, enrich, and transform your logs before deciding where they should be sent.
:::

:::warning
- Make sure the destination specified in the Reroute processor matches exactly with a target system name in your configuration
- Only one reroute processor will be executed in a pipeline, even if multiple conditions match
- Ensure your target system configurations are properly set up with all required credentials and endpoints
:::

## Advanced Usage

The Reroute processor is particularly powerful when combined with other processors in a pipeline. Common use cases include:

1. **Security Log Processing**:
   - Parse and normalize logs
   - Enrich with threat intelligence
   - Route high-risk events to security platforms

2. **Compliance Requirements**:
   - Filter sensitive data
   - Apply transformations
   - Route to specific compliance-mandated destinations

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Process high-volume logs
   - Filter out unnecessary data
   - Route important logs to premium storage/analysis platforms
