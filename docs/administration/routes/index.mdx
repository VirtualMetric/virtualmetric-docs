# Routes

Routes define how incoming data is filtered, processed, and directed to specific destinations. They act as traffic controllers, determining what data goes through which pipelines and ultimately reaches which targets.

In the following chapters we will detail their structure and behavior.

## Basics

Routes are typically made up of filtering expressions and sequences of processors used to shape the format and flow of the data streams. As such, they curate data through a rich and complex evaluation process, and forward that data to consumers downstream.

### Components

It should be obvious from their name that routes fundamentally select and forward data. Therefore, their behavior is characterized by the following elements:

<TermTable>
  <TermCol>**Conditions**</TermCol>
  <DefCol>Optional filter expressions that match specific events</DefCol>

  <TermCol>**Pipelines**</TermCol>
  <DefCol>Optional processing schemes applied to select events</DefCol>

  <TermCol>**Targets**</TermCol>
  <DefCol>One or more destinations to forward the processed data</DefCol>
</TermTable>

### Filtering

Selecting events typically involves evaluating boolean expressions such as

> `device.type == 'syslog'`\
> `dataset.name == 'firewall_logs'`\
> `log.severity > 4`\
> `!(source.ip == '10.0.0.1' || source.ip == '10.0.0.2')`

etc. which are applied to previously normalized data.

### Data Flow

Forwarding data involves controlling the flow, and there are several design patterns:

    B[/"Normalize"\]
    C[("Storage")]
    A --> B --> C
  ```

    A("Route")
    B{"Enrich"}
    C[("Monitoring")]
    D[("Storage")]
    E[("Backup")]
    
    A --> B
    B --> C & D & E
  ```

  graph LR
    A("Syslog")
    B("Winlog")
    C("Apache")
    D[/"Normalize"\]
    E[("Central Analytics")]
    
    A & B & C --> D --> E
  ```
---

### Pipelines

Routes can include zero or more pipelines. Multiple pipelines will process data sequentially. A pipeline's processors can override routing by using the `reroute` processor. The `final` processor terminates the pipeline's execution.

### Evaluation

Routes are evaluated in order, and there are some critical aspect to take into consideration:

* Route conditions are evaluated before the pipelines begin their work
* The first route that has a match processes the event
* The pipelines can then modify the flow or the direction of the data

No need to mention, multiple targets receive identical copies of the same data, so the above do not impact who receives what.

:::tip
To optimize performance, in addition to minimizing the number of routes and avoiding unnecessary pipeline duplications, filter as early as possible&mdash;using clear, specific and effective expressions&mdash;and always consider the order of evaluation carefully.

## Best Practices

As usual, a number of guidelines are in order when designing, using, and maintaining routes:

Use clear, descriptive names that bear the purpose, e.g. `apache_to_analytics`, and keep them consistent across similar routes.

When filtering, start with the most specific routes, and use precise and effective conditions, avoiding overlapping ones.

When assigning, use a single pipeline whenever possible. Document multi-pipeline routes as their intricacies may yield unexpected results. Duplicate data only if it is absolutely necessary.

Collate similar targets, documenting any mirroring requirements, and consider the target capacity and throughput.
