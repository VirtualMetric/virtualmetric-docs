# Routes: Overview

Routes define how incoming data is filtered, processed, and directed to specific destinations. They act as traffic controllers, determining which data goes through which pipelines and ultimately reaches which targets.

## Core Concepts

### Route Components

A route consists of several key components:

- **Name**: Unique identifier for the route
- **Condition**: Optional filter expression to determine which events match
- **Description**: Optional explanation of the route's purpose
- **Pipelines**: Optional processing steps applied to matching events
- **Targets**: One or more destinations for the processed data

### Filtering

Routes use boolean expressions to filter events. These expressions can reference:

- Device properties: `device.type == 'syslog'`
- Dataset attributes: `dataset.name == 'firewall_logs'`
- Event fields: `log.severity > 4`
- Complex conditions: `!(source.ip == '10.0.0.1' || source.ip == '10.0.0.2')`

### Data Flow

Routes support several data flow patterns:

1. **Single Source to Single Target**
   ```yaml
   routes:
     - name: basic_route
       pipelines:
         - normalize
       targets:
         - storage
   ```

2. **Single Source to Multiple Targets** (Mirroring)
   ```yaml
   routes:
     - name: mirror_route
       pipelines:
         - enrich
       targets:
         - primary_storage
         - backup_storage
         - monitoring
   ```

3. **Multiple Sources to Single Target**
   ```yaml
   routes:
     - name: aggregate_route
       if: "device.type in ['syslog', 'winlog', 'apache']"
       pipelines:
         - normalize
       targets:
         - central_analytics
   ```

### Pipeline Handling

- Routes can include zero or more pipelines
- Multiple pipelines will process data sequentially
- Pipeline processors can override routing using the `reroute` processor
- The `final` processor in a pipeline stops further processing

## Route Evaluation

Routes are evaluated in order, with important considerations:

1. First matching route processes the event
2. Multiple targets receive identical copies of the data
3. Pipeline processing can modify or redirect data flow
4. Route conditions are evaluated before pipeline processing begins

## Performance Considerations

To optimize route performance:

- Use specific conditions to filter early
- Minimize the number of routes
- Avoid unnecessary pipeline duplications
- Use efficient filtering expressions
- Consider the order of route evaluation

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Convention**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Include purpose in name (e.g., `apache_to_analytics`)
   - Keep names consistent across similar routes

2. **Filtering**
   - Start with most specific routes
   - Use efficient filter conditions
   - Avoid overlapping conditions when possible

3. **Pipeline Assignment**
   - Use single pipeline when possible
   - Only duplicate data when necessary
   - Document any multi-pipeline routes

4. **Target Configuration**
   - Group similar targets together
   - Document any mirroring requirements
   - Consider target capacity and throughput

## Common Patterns

### Pass-Through Route
```yaml
routes:
  - name: passthrough
    description: "Direct data flow without processing"
    targets:
      - raw_storage
```

### Conditional Route
```yaml
routes:
  - name: critical_errors
    if: "log.severity == 'critical'"
    description: "Route critical errors to urgent handling"
    pipelines:
      - error_handling
    targets:
      - urgent_alerts
      - error_storage
```

### Multi-Pipeline Route
```yaml
routes:
  - name: complex_processing
    description: "Multiple processing steps for special data"
    pipelines:
      - normalize
      - enrich
      - aggregate
    targets:
      - analytics_platform
```
