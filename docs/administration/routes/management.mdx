# Route Management

Management of a route involves defining how a log line is handled after it has been processed. This may involve further _filtering_ and _transformation_ as per the destination's data model. Each route can be viewed and edited on a per tenant basis.

Routes can be:

* added, copied, moved, and deleted
* selectively run
* grouped under a name
* run in clusters
