# Route: Quick Start

This guide will help you get started with routes by walking through common scenarios and configurations.

## Basic Route Creation

### 1. Simple Pass-Through Route

The simplest route forwards data directly to a target without processing:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: basic_forward
    description: "Forward all logs to storage"
    targets:
      - name: storage_target
```

### 2. Adding a Pipeline

Include basic processing with a pipeline:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: process_logs
    description: "Process and store logs"
    pipelines:
      - name: normalize_logs
    targets:
      - name: storage_target
```

### 3. Conditional Routing

Filter data based on conditions:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: firewall_logs
    description: "Process firewall logs"
    if: device.type == 'firewall'
    pipelines:
      - name: firewall_pipeline
    targets:
      - name: security_storage
```

## Common Use Cases

### Device-Based Routing

Route specific device types to different targets:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: syslog_route
    if: device.type == 'syslog'
    pipelines:
      - name: syslog_normalize
    targets:
      - name: syslog_storage

  - name: windows_route
    if: device.type == 'windows'
    pipelines:
      - name: windows_normalize
    targets:
      - name: windows_storage
```

### Dataset-Based Routing

Route different datasets to specific targets:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: security_dataset
    if: dataset.name == 'security_logs'
    pipelines:
      - name: security_process
    targets:
      - name: security_analytics

  - name: performance_dataset
    if: dataset.name == 'performance_metrics'
    pipelines:
      - name: metrics_process
    targets:
      - name: metrics_platform
```

### Data Mirroring

Send the same data to multiple targets:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: mirror_logs
    description: "Store logs in multiple locations"
    pipelines:
      - name: normalize
    targets:
      - name: primary_storage
      - name: backup_storage
      - name: analytics_platform
```

## Advanced Configurations

### Multiple Pipeline Processing

Process data through several pipelines:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: complex_processing
    description: "Multi-stage processing"
    pipelines:
      - name: normalize
      - name: enrich
      - name: aggregate
    targets:
      - name: analytics
```

### Conditional with Multiple Criteria

Complex filtering for specific scenarios:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: critical_errors
    if: log.severity == 'critical' && device.type == 'production'
    pipelines:
      - name: urgent_process
    targets:
      - name: alerts
      - name: storage
```

## Best Practices for Starting

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with basic routes
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Test each configuration

2. **Plan Your Structure**
   - List your data sources
   - Define target requirements
   - Identify processing needs

3. **Test and Monitor**
   - Verify data flow
   - Check processing results
   - Monitor performance

## Next Steps

After setting up basic routes:

1. Explore advanced filtering conditions
2. Implement data transformation pipelines
3. Configure multiple target destinations
4. Set up monitoring and alerts
5. Optimize route performance

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Verify route conditions are correct
- Check pipeline configurations
- Ensure targets are accessible
- Monitor route metrics
- Review processing logs
