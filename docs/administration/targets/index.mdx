# Targets

**Director** uses _targets_ as the output destinations to forward, store, and analyze collected telemetry data. Targets provide flexible options for data persistence and integration with various analysis platforms.

## Use Categories

### Local Storage

**Director** supports the following local data output methods:

* **Console** - Direct _stdout_ writing with real-time message viewing. Also provides debugging and testing capability, format normalization, and synchronous writing with mutex locking

* **Files** - Multiple file formats like JSON (line-delimited), Avro (binary serialization), OCF (container), Parquet (columnar) are available. In addition, compression options like ZSTD (default), GZIP, Snappy, Brotli, and LZ4 are also supported. Also, dynamic file naming, size-based rotation, buffer management, and schema validation are among the features.

### Cloud Storage

The integration options for the cloud are below:

* **Azure Blob** - Direct blob writing and multiple containers are supported. Available authentication methods are service principal and managed Identity. Other features include automatic retries, exponential backoff, size-based chunking, connection pooling, and buffer management.

* **Microsoft Sentinel** - Direct DCR integration and ASIM normalization are supported. In addition to standard tables, _WindowsEvent_, _SecurityEvent_, _CommonSecurityLog_, and _Syslog_ can be used. Various ASIM tables are also available. (See the [ASIM section](/docs/appendix.mdx#asim) for a complete list.)

## Deployment

The following deployment types can be used:

* **Single** (one-to-one) - data is routed to only one destination:

  ```mermaid
  block-beta
    columns 5
    A("Director"):1
    B(["Analysis Platform"]):2
    A --> B
  ```

* **Multiple** (one-to-many) - data is routed to two or more destinations:

  ```mermaid
  block-beta
    columns 5
    A("Director"):1
    space
    B[("Remote Site")]:2
    space
    space
    C[("Client Site")]:2
    space
    space
    D[("Local Storage")]:2
    A --> B
    A --> C
    A --> D
  ```

* **Chained** - data is routed sequentially from one destination to the next:

  ```mermaid
  block-beta
    columns 5
    space
    space
    C[/"Cloud
    Upload"\]:2
    D(["Analysis
    Platform"]):2
    A("Director"):1
    B[("Local
    Storage")]:3
    space
    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
  ```

## Use Cases

The most common uses of targets are:

* **Local analysis** - Debug logging, performance analysis, audit trails, and temporary storage.

* **Cloud integration** - Long-term storage, data warehousing, security analysis, and compliance monitoring

* **Real-time analysis** - Live monitoring, alert generation, trend analysis, and performance tracking

* **Data lake building** - Raw data storage, schema evolution, data partitioning, and analytics preparation

To serve these ends, the following _processing options_ are available:

* **Pipelines** - Field normalization (for ECS, CIM, ASIM, CEF, LEEF, and CSL), data transformation, message batching, custom field mapping, schema validation, and format conversion.

* **Buffer management** - Configurable buffer sizes, batch processing, flush intervals, queue management, checkpoint recovery, and error handling

* **Performance** - Asynchronous writing, buffer optimization, connection pooling, retry mechanisms, resource monitoring, and size-based rotation

* **Security** - Authentication using API keys, service principals, and client certificates. Encryption with TLS/SSL, HTTPS, or custom algorithms. Also, access control and audit logging.
