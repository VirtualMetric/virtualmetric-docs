# Applications

**VirtualMetric DataStream** is a telemetry pipeline solution that simplifies data collection, processing, and routing for _Microsoft Sentinel_ and other _Azure_ data services. At its core, **DataStream** uses pipelines to process, enrich, and direct data flows to their optimal destinations. It is composed of the following components:

## VirtualMetric Director&trade;

**VirtualMetric Director** is a tool designed for listening on various data sources, extracting and transforming them, and routing the data to destinations. This powerful component acts as the central nervous system of your pipeline, orchestrating the flow across your entire infrastructure.

**Director** provides a unified interface for managing multiple sources and destinations, enabling seamless data collection, transformation, and distribution. Its architecture is built to handle enterprise-scale data volumes at high levels of performance and reliability.

Key capabilities include:

* _Source Management_ - support for multiple protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP), file system monitoring, database change tracking, API integration, custom source implementations
* _Data Transformation_ - real-time data processing, rormat conversion, field extraction, data enrichment, custom transformation rules
* _Intelligent Routing_ - dynamic destination selection, load balancing, failover handling, priority-based routing, conditional routing
* _Monitoring and Control_ - real-time pipeline visibility, performance metrics, health monitoring, alert management, configuration validation

**Director**'s flexible architecture allows it to adapt to changing requirements. Whether you're collecting logs from applications or monitoring system metrics, or gathering security events, **Director** provides the necessary tools to help you ensure efficient data handling and delivery.

## VirtualMetric Agent&trade;

**VirtualMetric Agent** is a lightweight, high-performance data collection component designed to gather telemetry data from various sources while maintaining minimal system impact. This versatile agent serves as the first point of contact in the telemetry pipeline, ensuring reliable data collection and initial processing.

**Agent** is engineered with efficiency and reliability in mind, offering robust data collection without compromising system performance or stability.

Key features include:

* _Efficient Collection_ - low resource utilization, minimal CPU and memory footprint, optimized disk I/O, configurable collection intervals, adaptive rate limiting
* _Reliable Processing_ - local buffering, crash recovery, data persistence, automatic reconnection, error handling
* _Flexible Integration_ - multiple source types support, custom collector plugins, format adaptation, protocol conversion, destination selection
* _Advanced Monitoring_ - self-diagnostics, performance metrics and health status reporting, resource usage tracking, alert generation

**Agent**'s architecture ensures seamless data collection and transmission while providing robust monitoring and management capabilities. Its modular design allows for easy extension and customization to meet specific organizational needs. It can operate both independently and as part of a larger telemetry infrastructure, making it suitable for various deployment scenarios, from single-server installations to large-scale distributed environments.
