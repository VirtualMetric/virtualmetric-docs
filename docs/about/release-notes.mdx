# Release Notes

This release introduces major enterprise-focused features, along with important improvements in content management. With Single Sign-On, RBAC, and the first phase of the MSSP module, our platform becomes more secure, flexible, and enterprise-ready than ever before. Weâ€™ve also added more vendors to the Content Hub and introduced Auto Syslog Discovery to simplify log management.

## :rocket: New Features

- **Single Sign-On (SSO) with Microsoft Azure** - Users can now log in directly with their Azure credentials, reducing password fatigue and improving security.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Introduced predefined roles (Admin, Contributor, User) and support for creating custom roles. This gives organizations fine-grained control over access and permissions.
- **MSSP Module (Phase 1)** - Enterprise customers can now create and manage sub-tenants, switch between tenants, and define usage limits. This is the foundation for future phases, which will bring advanced capabilities like shared pipelines and global dashboards.

## :wrench: Improvements

### Content Hub

- **More Vendors Added** - We expanded the list of supported vendors, giving customers access to a wider range of parser packs out of the box.
- **Auto Syslog Discovery** - Automatically identifies the source behind each syslog message, ensuring clean and normalized logs without manual effort.
