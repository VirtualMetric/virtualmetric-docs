# Comparisons: Vector

**Vector** is a lightweight and high-performance observability data pipeline that's designed to collect, transform, and route logs and metrics. While it excels at efficient data processing and offers excellent performance characteristics due to its Rust implementation, it's primarily focused on being a pipeline component rather than a complete log management solution like **VirtualMetric**.

- **Strengths**: Low resource usage, simple deployment
- **Best for**: Edge deployments, high performance needs
- **Distinctive Features**: VRL language, observability focus

||VirtualMetric|Vector|

|Agentless Log Collection (auto-discovery)|Yes|Partial (requires configuration for each source, limited auto-discovery)|
|Log Delivery Guarantee (WAL)|Yes|Yes (disk buffers with WAL for most sinks)|
|Long-term Log storage|Yes|No (designed as a pipeline, requires external storage)|
|Compression|Up to 99%|Moderate (supports compression but not optimized for storage efficiency)|
|Processing Performance|High out-of-the-box|High (written in Rust for performance)|
|Forensic data Integrity|Yes|Partial (guarantees delivery but limited forensic features)|
