# Comparisons: Logstash

**Logstash** is primarily a data processing pipeline designed to be used as part of the Elastic Stack (formerly ELK Stack). While powerful for log processing, it has design goals different from **VirtualMetric**, focusing more on being a transformation layer between data sources and storage systems rather than a complete log management solution.

- **Strengths**: Vast plugin ecosystem, ELK stack integration
- **Best for**: Elasticsearch users, complex transformations
- **Distinctive Features**: Ruby-based filtering, mature ecosystem
