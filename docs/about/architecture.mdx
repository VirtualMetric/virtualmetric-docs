# Architecture

**VirtualMetric DataStream** is architected with enterprise security and data sovereignty as core principles. Unlike traditional solutions that require sending sensitive data to third-party cloud platforms for processing, **DataStream** keeps all your critical data within your environment while providing centralized management and visibility through a secure cloud control plane.

## Security-First Architecture

### Data Plane vs Control Plane Separation

**DataStream** employs a strict separation between data plane and control plane operations, ensuring your sensitive security data never leaves your environment:

**Control Plane (VirtualMetric Cloud)**
- Multi-tenant SaaS platform for centralized management
- Pipeline configuration and deployment
- Fleet management across all Directors and Agents
- Real-time statistics, monitoring, and alerting
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for team collaboration
- Zero data processing or storage of customer logs

**Data Plane (Customer Environment)**
- All data processing occurs within customer-controlled infrastructure
- Director processes, transforms, and routes data locally
- Agents collect data and communicate directly with local Director
- No customer data transmission to VirtualMetric Cloud
- Complete data sovereignty and compliance control

### Enterprise Security Benefits

This architecture addresses critical enterprise security concerns:

**Data Sovereignty** - All sensitive log data remains within your infrastructure, ensuring compliance with data residency requirements, industry regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX), and corporate data governance policies.

**Minimal Attack Surface** - Only a single HTTPS outbound connection required from Director to VirtualMetric Cloud for management, no inbound connections needed, and agents communicate exclusively with local Director infrastructure.

**Zero Third-Party Data Exposure** - Raw log data never transmitted to external vendors, eliminates risks of data breaches during transit, and maintains complete control over sensitive security information.

**Network Security** - Reduced firewall complexity with minimal external connections, no need to open firewall access from cloud to local systems, and simplified network security management.

**Bandwidth Optimization** - Processes data locally before routing to destinations, eliminates unnecessary raw data transmission, and provides intelligent compression and filtering capabilities.

## Deployment Architecture

### VirtualMetric Cloud (Multi-Tenant)

The centralized management platform provides:
- **Management Interface** - Intuitive web-based console for pipeline configuration and monitoring
- **Statistics & Analytics** - Real-time performance metrics, data flow visualization, and operational insights
- **RBAC & Security** - Granular access controls, audit logging, and secure authentication
- **Fleet Management** - Centralized deployment and configuration management across distributed environments

### Customer Environment Options

**VirtualMetric Director** can be deployed in multiple configurations to meet diverse enterprise requirements:

#### Clustered Director (High Availability)

- **Load Balancing** - Distributes processing load across multiple Director instances
- **Automatic Failover** - Ensures continuous operation during maintenance or failures
- **Scalable Processing** - Handles enterprise-scale data volumes with horizontal scaling
- **Shared Configuration** - Synchronized pipeline configurations across cluster nodes

#### Flexible Deployment Models

**On-Premises Deployment**
- Physical servers or virtual machines within customer data centers
- Complete isolation from external networks if required
- Integration with existing infrastructure and security controls

**Cloud Deployment** 
- Customer-owned Azure, Amazon, or other cloud environments
- Maintains data sovereignty within customer cloud tenants
- Leverages cloud-native services while preserving security isolation

**Hybrid Deployment**
- Directors in both on-premises and cloud environments
- Unified management through single control plane
- Flexible data routing based on location and requirements

### Container and Serverless Support

**Docker Containerization**
- Lightweight, portable deployment across environments
- Simplified installation and maintenance
- Container orchestration support (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Consistent runtime environment across platforms

**Azure Serverless Integration**
- **Director Proxy** - Azure Function-based secure data forwarding
- Automatic scaling based on data volume
- Pay-per-use cost optimization

## Network Communication

### Simplified Network Requirements

**Outbound HTTPS (Director to VirtualMetric Cloud)**
- Single port 443 connection for management communications
- Control plane synchronization and configuration updates
- Statistics reporting and health monitoring
- Secure token-based authentication

**Internal HTTPS (Agents to Director)**
- Direct communication between Agents and local Director
- No external connectivity required for Agents
- Secure data transmission within customer environment
- Simplified firewall configuration

### Zero Inbound Connectivity

**DataStream** requires no inbound connections from external networks, eliminating common security vulnerabilities:
- No firewall rules for external access to internal systems
- Reduced exposure to external threats
- Simplified compliance and security auditing
- Enhanced network security posture

## Management Models

### Managed (Default)

- **Centralized Configuration** - Manage all pipelines through VirtualMetric portal
- **Automatic Updates** - Seamless deployment of configuration changes and updates
- **Real-Time Monitoring** - Comprehensive visibility across distributed infrastructure
- **Collaborative Management** - Team-based access with RBAC controls

### Self-Managed (Air-Gapped)

For environments requiring complete network isolation:

- **Offline Configuration** - Manual pipeline configuration and deployment
- **Local Management** - Direct access to Director management interfaces
- **Manual Updates** - Administrator-controlled updates and maintenance
- **Complete Isolation** - Zero external connectivity requirements

### Benefits for Enterprise Environments

**Operational Efficiency**
- Centralized management of distributed telemetry infrastructure
- Reduced operational overhead with automated configuration deployment
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Streamlined troubleshooting and performance optimization

**Security & Compliance**
- Data never leaves customer-controlled environment
- Simplified compliance with industry regulations
- Reduced risk of data breaches and unauthorized access
- Enhanced audit trail and governance capabilities

**Scalability & Performance**
- High availability and clustering support for mission-critical environments
- Horizontal scaling to handle growing data volumes
- Intelligent load balancing and resource optimization
- Container and serverless deployment flexibility

**Cost Optimization**
- Eliminates costs associated with third-party data processing
- Reduces bandwidth requirements through local processing
- Flexible deployment models to optimize infrastructure costs
- Pay-per-use serverless options for variable workloads
