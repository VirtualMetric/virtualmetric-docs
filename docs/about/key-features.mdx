## Vectorized Processing Architecture

**DataStream**'s pipeline engine employs a sophisticated vectorized processing architecture that maximizes system resources by utilizing all available CPU cores. This design enables efficient processing of large log volumes and facilitates parallel data ingestion with multiple target platforms simultaneously.

The vectorized architecture breaks down incoming log streams into optimized chunks that can be processed independently across multiple cores. This parallelization ensures that system resources are used efficiently, preventing bottlenecks that commonly occur in single-threaded processing systems.

Each processing core operates independently on its assigned data chunk, performing tasks such as parsing, filtering, schema transformation, and enrichment. This parallel processing approach significantly reduces the overall processing time and enables real-time data handling even under heavy loads.

## Lossless Pipeline Engine

Our _Write-Ahead Log_ (WAL) architecture provides a robust foundation for data integrity by securely storing all routing and pipeline states on disk. This architecture ensures that every piece of data is safely persisted before processing, creating a reliable recovery point in case of system failures or unexpected shutdowns.

The WAL implementation in **DataStream** operates as a high-performance buffer between data collection and processing stages. When data arrives, it is immediately written to the WAL before any processing begins, creating a durable record of all incoming information. This approach guarantees that no data is lost during pipeline processing or system transitions.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Input[Input Data] --> WAL[Write-Ahead Log]
    WAL --> Disk[(Disk Storage)]
    WAL --> Pipeline([Pipeline Processing])

    subgraph Recovery
        Disk --> |Crash Restore| Pipeline
    end
    
    style WAL fill:#BCC0E7
    style Disk fill:#E5E2FB
```

Unlike solutions that require additional components like Kafka, **DataStream** caps log duplication at just one message. This ensures zero data loss, even in the event of a crash, while maintaining efficient storage utilization. The system achieves this through a sophisticated checkpoint mechanism that tracks the processing state of each message.

The _WAL_ approach also minimizes the risk of system downtime, ensuring that your telemetry pipeline is always up and running, and consistent, even under heavy loads. When the system restarts after an interruption, it can seamlessly resume processing from the last recorded state without data loss or duplication.

Key features include:

* **Zero data loss guarantee** - all data is persisted before processing
* **Minimal message duplication** - maximum of one copy per message
* **Automatic crash recovery** - seamless resumption after system interruptions
* **State preservation** - maintains pipeline and routing states on disk
* **High throughput** - efficient write-ahead logging with minimal overhead
* **System consistency** - ensures data integrity across pipeline stages
* **Multi-platform reliability** - consistent data delivery across all target platforms
