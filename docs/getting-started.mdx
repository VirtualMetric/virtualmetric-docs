# Getting Started

To download, install, and run **VirtualMetric Director**, follow the instructions below.

## System Requirements

**Director** is agnostic to its platform. It can run on any of the supported 32-bit and 64-bit versions of **PowerShell**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **Solaris**, and **AIX**. Its minimum requirements are:

- **150MB** of memory
- **250MB** of disk space

{/* TODO: Hepsi bu kadar mı? Sistemde olması gereken DLL'lerin veya SO'ların minimum sürümü falan yok mu? */}

## Download and Install

**VirtualMetric Director** does _not_ require any installation: you can place it in any directory you wish.

You can download the **Director** ZIP package by clicking [this link](www.example.com). Once it is downloaded, unzip the contents and move them where you want.

If you have access to **Platform**, you can also download it through the CLI by first navigating to the directory where you wish to install it (an existing or newly created one for VirtualMetric) and then entering the following one-liner:
