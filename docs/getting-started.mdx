# Getting Started

To download, install, and run **VirtualMetric Director**, follow the instructions below.

## System Requirements

**Director** supports amd64 and arm64 versions of **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**. Its minimum requirements are:

- 1 **CPU** core
- **150MB** of memory
- **250MB** of disk space

We recommend using a machine with at least 2 CPU cores. Since **VirtualMetric Director** uses a vectorized pipeline, it can utilize all available cores, so having more than one core will improve performance.

## Installation Methods

You can install **VirtualMetric Director** online or offline, depending on your system's internet access.
Installation does not require any dependencies or prerequisites.
VirtualMetric Director is a single binary, so you can easily download and install it on your system.
You can install Director on a traditional server or virtual machine on-premises, or in the cloud.
It can also be deployed as Azure Apps for serverless requirements.

## Online Installation

If your system has internet access, you can use our automated installation scripts for quick setup.
