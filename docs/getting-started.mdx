# Getting Started

To download, install, and run **VirtualMetric Director**, follow the instructions below.

## System Requirements

**Director** supports amd64 and arm64 versions of **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**. Its minimum requirements are:

- 1 **CPU** core
- **150MB** of memory
- **250MB** of disk space

We recommend using a machine with at least 2 CPU cores. Since **VirtualMetric Director** uses a vectorized pipeline, it can utilize all available cores, so having more than one core will improve performance.

## Download and Install

**VirtualMetric Director** does _not_ require any installation: you can place it in any directory you wish.

You can download the **Director** ZIP package by clicking [this link](www.example.com). Once it is downloaded, unzip the contents and move them where you want.

If you have access to **Platform**, you can also download it through the CLI by first navigating to the directory where you wish to install it (an existing or newly created one for VirtualMetric) and then entering the following one-liner:

  <TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" default>
  ```PowerShell
  iwr dl.vget.me | iex
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
  ```bash
  curl -sL dl.vget.me | bash
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you press <kb-short>Enter</kb-short>, you will see the following screen showing the progress:
