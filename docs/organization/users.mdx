# Users

This is where you manage user accounts within your **DataStream** organization. You can create new users, assign roles and permissions, monitor activity, and control access across your platform.

## Accessing User Management

The **Users** interface is accessible through two paths:

From the <gui>Organization</gui> dashboard, 

1. Navigate to <gui>Home</gui> > <gui>Organization</gui> pane
2. Click <gui>Manage Users</gui>.

Alternatively, 

1. Click the hamburger menu in the top left corner
2. Select <gui>Organization</gui> > <gui>Users</gui>.

## Users Interface Overview

The main **Users** view provides a comprehensive dashboard for managing all user accounts within your organization. The interface includes several key components:

### Users Table

The central table displays essential information for all registered users:

- **Full name** - First and last name of each user
- **Email** - Primary contact address and sign-in credential
- **User Role** - Assigned role defining permissions and access levels
- **Status** - Current account status (**Active** or **Passive**)

### Interface Controls

Above the table, you'll find the <gui>Search users</gui> field on the left for locating users by name or email, and a <gui>Status filter</gui> dropdown to show **All**, **Active**, or **Passive** accounts. The <gui>Add new user</gui> button appears in the top right corner.

At the bottom of the table, pagination controls let you adjust <gui>Items per page</gui> (10, 25, or 50) and navigate between pages.

### Actions Menu

On the right side of each user row, a vertical ellipsis (&#x22EE;) opens the <gui>Actions</gui> dropdown. From here you can select 

- <gui>Manage user</gui> to open detailed configuration,
- <gui>Delete user</gui> to permanently remove the account, or
- <gui>Disable user</gui> / <gui>Enable user</gui> to toggle access without deletion.

## Creating New Users

To add a new user to your organization:

1. Click the <gui>Add new user</gui> button in the Users interface
2. Enter all required user details (see User Details section below).
3. Configure initial permissions and role assignments
3. Click <gui>Add user</gui> to complete the creation process

The new user will appear in the **Users** table.

:::info Important
Only **Admin** users can add new accounts.

If account creation fails, the most common cause is a duplicate email address—each email must be unique within the organization.
:::

## User Account Configuration

When creating or managing users, you'll configure several key areas of account information:

### User Details

This section contains the core account information.

- Enter the user's full name for identification and their primary email address, which serves as both the authentication credential and notification contact. The email must be valid and current.
- You can also set the user's timezone preference for date and time display and their preferred interface language.
- Finally, set a password for account access, then assign a role to define the user's access level and capabilities.

:::tip
Use a strong password, containing a mixture of capital letters, small letters, digits, and symbols.
:::

### Available User Roles

The system provides predefined role templates with specific permission sets:

- **User (Read Only)** - Provides read-only access to data streams and basic platform features
- **Admin** - Grants full administrative access to data streams, user management, and configuration

## Managing Existing Users

The user management system provides comprehensive tools for maintaining and monitoring user accounts:

### Edit

To modify an existing user account:

1. In the Users table, select the user you want to modify
2. Click the actions menu (&#x22EE;) and select <gui>Manage user</gui>
3. Or click directly on the user row to access their details
4. Click <gui>Manage user details</gui> to activate the editing form
5. Modify any of the configurable fields as needed
6. Make role changes if you have sufficient permissions
7. Click <gui>Save changes</gui> to apply your modifications

Changes take effect immediately.

### Roles

Role changes may require transfer of ownership for certain resources or configurations.

:::note
You cannot assign a role with higher permissions than your own. To elevate a user to **Admin**, the change must be made by an existing **Admin** or organization **Owner**.

### Status

Users can be temporarily disabled without deletion. Disabling a user blocks their access while preserving all account data—the user cannot sign in, but their information remains intact and the action can be reversed at any time.

To restore access for a previously disabled account, enable the user. All previous permissions and configurations are maintained.

### Delete

To permanently remove a user account:

1. Open the Actions menu (&#x22EE;) in the **Users** table
2. Select <gui>Delete user</gui>, or from the **User Details** page click <gui>Actions</gui> > <gui>Delete</gui>.

:::warning
Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. All access records and audit history for this user are removed. If you may need to restore access later, disable the account instead.
:::

## User Activity Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive activity tracking through the **Access Details** section, which maintains detailed logs of user interactions:

### Log Fields

The access log captures essential details for security and audit purposes:

- **Email** - User identification for the logged activity
- **User IP** - Source IP address during access session
- **Object Type** - Category of system resource accessed
- **Object** - Specific name of the accessed resource
- **Action** - Type of operation performed
- **Action Description** - Detailed explanation of the performed task
- **Date** - Timestamp of the access event

### Usage

Activity monitoring enables security auditing by tracking user behavior and identifying unusual activity patterns. The logs support compliance reporting for regulatory requirements and help troubleshoot user-reported issues or system problems. You can also use them for usage analysis to understand how users interact with the platform.

## Administrative Notes

**DataStream** provides two predefined roles: **User (Read Only)** for monitoring access and **Admin** for full configuration control.

- The **Access Details** section logs all user activity with IP addresses, accessed resources, and timestamps. Review these logs periodically to verify that access patterns align with user responsibilities, particularly after role changes or during security reviews.

- If a user cannot sign in, first check their status in the <gui>Users</gui> table. Accounts marked **Passive** are disabled and must be re-enabled before the user can authenticate. If the status shows **Active**, check the **Access Details** logs for failed login attempts, which may indicate credential issues.
