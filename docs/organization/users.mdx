# Users

The **Users** interface provides comprehensive user account management capabilities within the **DataStream** platform. This centralized system allows administrators to create, configure, monitor, and maintain user accounts, permissions, and access controls across your organization.

## Accessing User Management

The **Users** interface is accessible through two paths:

**Via Organization Dashboard:**
- Navigate to **Home** > **Organization** pane
- Click **Manage Users**

**Via Main Navigation:**
- Click the hamburger menu (top left)
- Select **Organization** > **Users**

## Users Interface Overview

The main **Users** view provides a comprehensive dashboard for managing all user accounts within your organization. The interface includes several key components:

### Users Table
The central table displays essential information for all registered users:
- **Full name** - First and last name of each user
- **Email** - Primary contact address and sign-in credential
- **User Role** - Assigned role defining permissions and access levels
- **Status** - Current account status (*Active* or *Passive*)

### Interface Controls
The interface provides several tools for efficient user management:
- **Search users** - Text field to quickly locate users by name or email
- **Status filter** - Dropdown menu to filter by status (All, Active, Passive)
- <gui>Add new user</gui> - Primary action button to initiate user creation
- **Items per page** - Pagination control (10, 25, 50 items per page)
- **Page navigation** - Current page indicator and navigation controls

### Actions Menu
Each user row includes a vertical ellipsis (&#x22EE;) that opens the **Actions** dropdown with available operations:
- <gui>Manage user</gui> - Navigate to detailed user configuration
- <gui>Delete user</gui> - Remove user account (revokes all access)
- <gui>Disable user</gui> / <gui>Enable user</gui> - Toggle user access without deletion

## Creating New Users

To add a new user to your organization:

1. **Access User Creation**
   - Click the <gui>Add new user</gui> button in the Users interface

2. **Complete User Information**
   - Enter all required user details (see User Details section below)
   - Configure initial permissions and role assignments

3. **Finalize Account**
   - Click <gui>Add user</gui> to complete the creation process
   - The new user will appear in the Users table

## User Account Configuration

When creating or managing users, you'll configure several key areas of account information:

### User Details
This section contains the core account information:

**Personal Information:**
- **Full name** - First and last name for identification
- **User email** - Primary email for authentication and notifications (must be valid and current)
- **Timezone preference** - User's locale setting for date and time display
- **Language** - Preferred interface language

**Authentication:**
- **Password** - Set secure password for user account access

**Permissions and Access:**
- **Select role and user permissions** - Define user's access level and capabilities

### Available User Roles
The system provides predefined role templates with specific permission sets:

- **User (Read Only)** - Provides read-only access to data streams and basic platform features
- **Admin** - Grants full administrative access to data streams, user management, and configuration

## Managing Existing Users

The user management system provides comprehensive tools for maintaining and monitoring user accounts:

### Editing User Accounts
To modify an existing user account:

1. **Access User Management**
   - In the Users table, select the user you want to modify
   - Click the actions menu (&#x22EE;) and select <gui>Manage user</gui>
   - Or click directly on the user row to access their details

2. **Edit Account Information**
   - Click <gui>Manage user details</gui> to activate the editing form
   - Modify any of the configurable fields as needed
   - Make role changes if you have sufficient permissions

3. **Save Changes**
   - Click <gui>Save changes</gui> to apply your modifications
   - Changes take effect immediately

### Role Management Considerations
When modifying user roles, keep these important restrictions in mind:

- You cannot assign a role higher than your own permission level
- Only users with sufficient permissions (Admin or Owner roles) can modify another user's role
- Role changes may require transfer of ownership for certain resources or configurations

<Demo id="users-manage" />

### Account Status Management
Users can be temporarily disabled without deletion:

**Disabling Users:**
- Temporarily blocks user access while preserving account data
- User cannot sign in but account information remains intact
- Can be reversed by enabling the account

**Enabling Users:**
- Restores access for previously disabled accounts
- All previous permissions and configurations are maintained

### User Deletion
To permanently remove a user account:

1. **Access Deletion Options**
   - From the Users table: Select user > Actions menu (&#x22EE;) > <gui>Delete user</gui>
   - From User Details page: Click **Actions** dropdown > <gui>Delete</gui>

2. **Confirm Removal**
   - The user account is permanently deleted
   - User loses all access to the organization
   - This action cannot be undone

## User Activity Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive activity tracking through the **Access Details** section, which maintains detailed logs of user interactions:

### Activity Log Information
The access log captures essential details for security and audit purposes:

- **Email** - User identification for the logged activity
- **User IP** - Source IP address during access session
- **Object Type** - Category of system resource accessed
- **Object** - Specific name of the accessed resource
- **Action** - Type of operation performed
- **Action Description** - Detailed explanation of the performed task
- **Date** - Timestamp of the access event

### Using Activity Logs
Activity monitoring serves several important functions:
- **Security auditing** - Track user behavior and identify unusual activity
- **Compliance reporting** - Generate access reports for regulatory requirements
- **Troubleshooting** - Investigate user-reported issues or system problems
- **Usage analysis** - Understand how users interact with the platform

## User Management Best Practices

### Account Security
- Ensure all users have strong, unique passwords
- Regularly review user access levels and remove unnecessary permissions
- Monitor user activity logs for suspicious behavior
- Disable accounts immediately when users leave the organization

### Permission Management
- Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles
- Regularly audit user permissions to ensure they align with current responsibilities
- Document permission changes and maintain approval workflows
- Consider role-based access control for consistent permission management

### Account Lifecycle
- Establish clear processes for user onboarding and offboarding
- Maintain up-to-date contact information for all users
- Regularly review inactive accounts and disable or remove as appropriate
- Plan for succession and knowledge transfer when users change roles

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Account Creation Issues
1. Ensure email address is unique within the organization
2. Verify all required fields are completed
3. Confirm you have administrative permissions to create users
4. Check that user quotas or limits haven't been exceeded

### User Cannot Access System
1. Verify user status is **Active**
2. Confirm email address is correct
3. Check that user role has appropriate permissions
4. Review recent activity logs for failed login attempts

### Permission-Related Problems
1. Verify user role assignments match intended access level
2. Confirm your administrative privileges allow the required changes
3. Check for conflicts between role permissions and resource-specific settings
