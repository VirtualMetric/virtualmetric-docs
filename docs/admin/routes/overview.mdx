# Routes Overview

Routes are the stage where incoming events are filtered to select a correct subset that will be delivered tol a certain pipeline. Events that will directly delivered to the pipeline naturally do not need to be cloned.

The selection process is carried out by applying filters. These are essentially expressions that evaluate to _boolean_ values:

* `dataset == daily_log`
* `! (field == log.foo || field == log.bar)`
* `log.date >= '2024-10-14`

A set of such filtering, cloning, and aggregation operations are called **Routes**. Each filtering operation's efficiency can be measured as a proportion in execution time to the overall throughput of the inbound data.
