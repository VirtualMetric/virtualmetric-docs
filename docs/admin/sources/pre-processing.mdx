This is the stage where the pipelines attached to a Source perform the following operations take place before the data is delivered to a later stage, such as indexing or analysis:

* transformation
* enrichment

Typcially, this is where the data format is modified after processors are applied to all data points. Fields extracted at this stage are directed to [routes](../routes/overview.mdx).

We offer unique features to handle these operations:
