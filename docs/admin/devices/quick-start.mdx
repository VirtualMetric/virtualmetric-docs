# Devices: Quick Start

## Basic Ingestion

To be able to ingest data, first **Director** has to be given the information about the devices that will be used. This makes it possible to collect data remotely from devices that run an OS, such as **Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**, etc.

## Collect Published Data

There is also a category of devices that cannot be accessed remotely but nevertheless publish their data. The streams from these can be be collected via certain protocols&mdash;e.g. **Syslog**, **Netflow**, etc.

## Typical Use

Assume we have the following device configuration:

```yaml
devices:
  - id: 1
    name: "syslog listener"
    description: syslog
    type: syslog
    properties:
      address: "0.0.0.0"
      port: 514
```

With this device, we can do the following:

- Listen to **Syslog** over a regular **UDP** connection
- Listen to **Syslog** over a regular **TCP** connection launched by a pre-processor pipeline
- Launch a **Syslog** over **TLS**; requires configuring how to introduce a server certificate
- Collect data with a **TCP** line parser
