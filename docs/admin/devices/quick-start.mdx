# Devices Quick Start

## Basic Setup

**Director** is given the information about the devices that will be used to collect data. This makes it possible to collect data remotely from devices that run an OS, such as **Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**, etc.

There is also a category of devices that cannot be accessed remotely but nevertheless publish their data. The streams from these can be be collected via certain protocols&mdash;e.g. **Syslog**, **Netflow**, etc.

{/*

TODO: Check whether we support the following Crible features:

* deploying stream instances close to Syslog producers to minimize data loss (esp. with UDP), and using load balancers across multiple nodes to avoid overloading a single process.
* ensuring data integrity during downstream outages by using persistent queues to buffer incoming events
