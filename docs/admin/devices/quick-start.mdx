# Devices: Quick Start

## Ingestion

To be able to ingest data, first **Director** has to be given the information about the devices that will be used. This makes it possible to collect data remotely from devices that run an OS, such as **Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**, etc.

## Published Data

There is also a category of devices that cannot be accessed remotely but nevertheless publish their data. The streams from these can be be collected via certain protocols&mdash;e.g. **Syslog**, **Netflow**, etc.
