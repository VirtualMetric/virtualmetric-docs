# Devices: Quick Start

## Ingestion

To be able to ingest data, first **Director** has to be given the information about the devices that will be used. This makes it possible to collect data remotely from devices that run an OS, such as **Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**, etc.

## Published Data

There is also a category of devices that cannot be accessed remotely but nevertheless publish their data. The streams from these can be be collected via certain protocols&mdash;e.g. **Syslog**, **Netflow**, etc.

## Message Formats

As the data that listeners are receiving is by definition an infinite stream, some method of signalling which blocks contain what type of information has to be devised so that the listeners can marshall the received data in an intelligible form. One common technique is using line or record terminator characters to split the data into chunks.
