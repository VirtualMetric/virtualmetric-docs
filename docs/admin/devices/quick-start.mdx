# Devices: Quick Start

This quick start will walk you through the steps to configure a device for **Director**. As an example, we will pick a widely used log format, namely _syslog_, so we will configure a **Syslog** device.

## Create The YAML File

As we will create a **Syslog** device, we will begin by creating a `syslog.yaml` file under `<vm_root>` (the directory where you have installed **Director**) with which we will define the parameters required to initialize and use a listener.

## Define The Parameters

Now, we have to define the parameters that will identify _syslog_ listener as a device:

```yaml
devices
   id: 324235346
   name: 127.0.0.1
   type: syslog
   status: false
```

Why these values? For the time being, bear with us etc.

## Define The Properties

Now we have to define the properties that are device-specific. For our example these will be

```yaml
   properties:
      network: "udp"
      address: "0.0.0.0"
      port: 14514
      tls: false
      cert_name: ""
      key_name: ""
      reuse: false
      flush_interval: 1
      queue:
         interval: 1
      batch_size: 1000
```

Again, why these values? Please be patient, etc.
