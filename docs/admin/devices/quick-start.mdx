# Devices: Quick Start

This quick start will walk you through the steps to configure a device for **Director**. As an example, we will pick a widely used log format, namely _syslog_.

As we will create a _Syslog_ device, we will begin by creating a `syslog.yaml` file with which we will define the parameters required to initialize and use its listener.

## Define The Common Parameters

## Define The Properties

```yaml
```
