# Devices Overview

Devices are essentially listeners that act as proxies for actual senders of data. As such, they are the initial points for the process of decoupling the telemetry chain from physical sources.

## Motivation

The motivation behind using this abstraction layer can be summarized with the following bullet points:

* **Identification** Devices can be identified by source IP, hostname, MAC address, or structured metadata
* **Data marshalling** Devices can be tagged and grouped for filtering, routing, or enrichment
* **Efficiency**: As they are used before forwarding the data upstream, devices keep preprocessing local. Also, lightweight agents can be used. Standardized fields ensure devices and their logs can be correlated efficiently
* **Asset management**: Devices can indicate health, display events, and monitor telemetric activity
* **Security**: Devices can be represented as network entities

## Basic Setup

**Director** is given the information about the devices that will be used to collect data. This makes it possible to collect data remotely from devices that run an OS, such as **Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**, etc.

There is also a category of devices that cannot be accessed remotely but nevertheless publish their data. The streams from these can be be collected via certain protocols&mdash;e.g. **Syslog**, **Netflow**, etc.

## Typical Uses

Let us assume we have the following device configuration:

```yaml
devices:
  - id: 1
    name: "syslog listener"
    description: syslog
    type: syslog
    properties:
      address: "0.0.0.0"
      port: 514
```

With this device, we can do the following:

* Listen to **Syslog** over a regular **UDP** connection
* Listen to **Syslog** over a regular **TCP** connection launched by a pre-processor pipeline
* Launch a **Syslog** over **TLS**; requires configuring how to introduce a server certificate
* Collect data with a **TCP** line parser
