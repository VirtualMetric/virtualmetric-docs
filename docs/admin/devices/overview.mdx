# Devices: Overview

Devices are essentially listeners that act as proxies for actual senders of data. As such, they are the initial points for the process of _decoupling_ the telemetry chain from actual _physical_ sources.

## Motivation

The primary reasons for using this abstraction layer can be summarized with the following bullet points:

* **Identification** Devices can be identified by source IP, hostname, MAC address, or metadata
* **Data marshalling** Devices can be tagged and grouped for filtering, routing, and enrichment
* **Efficiency**: As they are used before forwarding the data upstream, devices keep preprocessing local. Also, lightweight agents can be used. Standardized fields ensure devices and their logs can be correlated efficiently
* **Asset management**: Devices can indicate system health, display events, and monitor telemetric activity
* **Security**: Devices can be represented as network entities and their activities can be tracked

Thanks to this design, devices can provide the following advantages which may help reduce telemetry costs:

{/* TODO: Do we support the following features? */}

* deploying stream instances close to data producers to minimize data loss
* using load balancers across multiple nodes to avoid overloading a single process.
* using persistent queues to buffer incoming events to ensure data integrity during downstream outages

{/* TODO: Complete */}

## Data Ingestion

To be able to ingest data, first **Director** has to be given the information about the devices that will be used. This makes it possible to collect data remotely from devices that run an OS, such as **Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**, etc.

## Published Data

There is also a category of devices that cannot be accessed remotely but nevertheless publish their data. The streams from these can be be collected via certain protocols&mdash;e.g. **Syslog**, **Netflow**, etc.

## Message Formats

As the data that listeners are receiving is by definition an infinite stream, some method of signalling which blocks contain what type of information has to be devised so that the listeners can marshall the received data in an intelligible form. One common technique is using line or record terminator characters to split the data into chunks.
