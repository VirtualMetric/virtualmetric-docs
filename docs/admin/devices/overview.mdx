# Devices Overview

Devices are essentially listeners that act as proxies for actual senders of data. As such, they are the initial points for the process of decoupling the telemetry chain from physical sources.

## Motivation

* **Identification**: Devices can be identified source IP, hostname, MAC address, or structured metadata
* **Data marshalling**: Devices can be tagged and grouped for filtering, routing, or enrichment
* **Efficiency**: Keeping preprocessing local, before forwarding the data upstream upstream. Also, lightweight agents can be used. Standardized fields ensure devices and their logs can be correlated efficiently
* **Assert management**: They can show health, events, and telemetry
* **Security**: Devices can be represented as network entities

## The Process

**Director** is given the information on which devices will be used to collect data. This is possible for remote collection on devices that run an OS, such as **Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**, etc.

There is also the category of devices that cannot be accessed remotely but publish their data. The data from these can be be collected via certain protocols&mdash;e.g. Syslog, Netflow.

The listener that is initialized to collect this type of data is referred to as a device.

## Typical Uses

```yaml
devices:
  - id: 1
    name: "syslog listener"
    description: syslog
    type: syslog
    properties:
      address: "0.0.0.0"
      port: 514
```

### Examples

* Listening to Syslog over a regular **UDP** connection
* Listening to Syslog over a regular **TCP** which is launched by a pre-processor pipeline
* Launching a Syslog over TLS; requires configuring how to introduce a server certificate
* Collecting data with a TCP line parser
