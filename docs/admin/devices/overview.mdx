# Devices: Overview

Devices are essentially listeners that act as proxies for actual senders of data. As such, they are the initial points for the process of _decoupling_ the telemetry chain from actual _physical_ sources.

## Motivation

The primary reasons for using this abstraction layer can be summarized with the following bullet points:

* **Identification** Devices can be identified by source IP, hostname, MAC address, or metadata
* **Data marshalling** Devices can be tagged and grouped for filtering, routing, and enrichment
* **Efficiency**: As they are used before forwarding the data upstream, devices keep preprocessing local. Also, lightweight agents can be used. Standardized fields ensure devices and their logs can be correlated efficiently
* **Asset management**: Devices can indicate system health, display events, and monitor telemetric activity
* **Security**: Devices can be represented as network entities and their activities can be tracked

Thanks to this design, devices can provide the following advantages which may help reduce telemetry costs:

* deploying stream instances close to data producers to minimize data loss
* using load balancers across multiple nodes to avoid overloading a single process.
* using persistent queues to buffer incoming events to ensure data integrity during downstream outages
