# HTTP

## Description

## Common Settings

## Contents

### 1. Request Line (For HTTP Requests)

   - **Method**: The action to be performed.
     - Common methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH`.
   - **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: The resource being requested (e.g., `/index.html`).
   - **HTTP Version**: The version of HTTP used (e.g., `HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2`).

### 2. Status Line (For HTTP Responses)

   - **HTTP Version**: The version of HTTP used in the response.
   - **Status Code**: A 3-digit code indicating the result of the request.
     - Common status codes:
       - `200 OK`: Successful request.
       - `301 Moved Permanently`: Resource moved.
       - `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
       - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error.
   - **Reason Phrase**: A textual description of the status code.

### 3. Headers

	- Key-value pairs that provide metadata about the request or response.
   - Common headers:
     - **Request Headers**:
       - `Host`: Specifies the server's hostname.
       - `User-Agent`: Identifies the client making the request.
       - `Accept`: Specifies acceptable content types (e.g., `text/html`).
       - `Authorization`: Includes credentials for authentication.
     - **Response Headers**:
       - `Content-Type`: Specifies the type of content returned (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).
       - `Content-Length`: Indicates the size of the response body.
       - `Set-Cookie`: Sets a cookie in the client.
       - `Server`: Information about the server handling the request.

### 4. Body

   - The data being sent or received.
   - **Request Body**: Often used with methods like `POST` or `PUT` to send data (e.g., form inputs, JSON payloads).
   - **Response Body**: Contains the content of the response (e.g., HTML, JSON, or binary data).

### 5. Methods (Request Type)

   - Defines the desired operation on the resource.
   - Examples:
     - `GET`: Retrieve data from the server.
     - `POST`: Submit data to the server.
     - `PUT`: Update a resource.
     - `DELETE`: Remove a resource.

### 6. Status Codes (Response Type)

   - Categorized into five classes:
     - **1xx (Informational)**: Request received, continuing process.
     - **2xx (Success)**: Request successfully received, understood, and accepted.
     - **3xx (Redirection)**: Further action needed to complete the request.
     - **4xx (Client Error)**: Request contains errors (e.g., bad syntax, unauthorized).
     - **5xx (Server Error)**: Server failed to fulfill a valid request.

### 7. Cookies

   - Key-value pairs sent by the server to the client to store stateful information.
   - Included in subsequent requests to the server.

---

### 8. Protocol Features

   - **Statelessness**: Each request is independent, with no inherent connection between requests.
   - **Caching**: Mechanisms like `ETag`, `Cache-Control`, and `Expires` for optimizing resource delivery.
   - **Compression**: Encoding like `gzip` or `deflate` for reducing payload size.
   - **Persistent Connections**: With `HTTP/1.1` and later, connections can be reused for multiple requests.

### 9. Secure Communication

   - **HTTPS**: Uses SSL/TLS to encrypt HTTP traffic, providing confidentiality and integrity.

### 10. Transport

   - Typically relies on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for transport.
   - Default ports:
     - `80` for HTTP.
     - `443` for HTTPS.

This structure allows HTTP to support a wide range of applications, from simple websites to complex APIs and distributed systems.
