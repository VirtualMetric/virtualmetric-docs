# Grok

:::info[synopsis]
Extracts structured fields out of a single text field within a document. You choose which field to extract matched fields from, as well as the grok pattern you expect will match. A grok pattern is like a regular expression that supports aliased expressions that can be reused.

Comes with reusable patterns.
:::

|Field|Type|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`field`|String|Y|N/A|The field containing the grok expression to be parsed|
|`patterns`|Strings|Y|N/A|Ordered list of grok expressions to match with named captures. Returns the first match|
|`description`|String|N|-|Explanatory note|
|`if`|String|N|-|Execute on this condition|
|`ignore_failure`|Logical|N|`false`|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`ignore_missing`|Logical|N|`false`|If `true` and `field` does not exist or is `null`, exit quietly without making any modifications|
|`on_failure`|Processors|N|-|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`on_success`|Processors|N|-|Use to inform the user that no errors were raised or to specify the next processor to run|
|`pattern_definitions`|String$\rightarrow$String|N|-|A map of _name_$\rightarrow$_pattern_ tuples. Patterns matching existing names override the pre-existing ones|
|`tag`|String|N|-|Identifier|
|`trace_match`|Logical|N|`false`|Inserts `_ingest._grok_match_index` into the matched document's metadata, along with the index of the pattern that matched|
