# Grok

<Synopsis>
Extracts structured fields out of a single text field within a document.
</Synopsis>

You choose which field to extract matched fields from, as well as the grok pattern you expect will match. A grok pattern is like a regular expression that supports aliased expressions that can be reused.

Comes with reusable patterns.

## Parameters

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`field`|Y|N/A|The field containing the grok expression to be parsed|
|`patterns`|Y|N/A|Ordered list of grok expressions to match with named captures. Returns the first match|
|`description`|N|-|Explanatory note|
|`if`|N|-|Condition to run|
|`ignore_failure`|N|`false`|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`ignore_missing`|N|`false`|If `true` and `field` does not exist or is `null`, exit quietly without making any modifications|
|`on_failure`|N|-|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`on_success`|N|-|Use to inform the user that no errors were raised or to specify the next processor to run|
|`pattern_definitions`|N|-|A map of _name_$\rightarrow$_pattern_ tuples. Patterns matching existing names override the pre-existing ones|
|`tag`|N|-|Identifier|
|`trace_match`|N|`false`|Inserts `_ingest._grok_match_index` into the matched document's metadata, along with the index of the pattern that matched|
