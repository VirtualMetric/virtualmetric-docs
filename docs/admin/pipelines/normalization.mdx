# Normalization

Normalization is the stage where data points are prepared for further processing by a consumer. This is the phase of transforming the structure of the data&mdash;whether it is what is received from sources or what will be directed to destinations&mdash;in order to make it fit for processing downstream. The primary tool for this process is once again pipelines.

Normalization takes place between:

* Sources and Routes
* Routes and Targets
