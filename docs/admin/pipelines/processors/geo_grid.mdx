# Geo Grid

<Synopsis>
Transforms geo-grid definitions of tiles or cells into standard bounding boxes or polygons that represent their shapes.
</Synopsis>

This is particularly useful for enabling spatial indexing and operations on the tile shapes.

For instance, a geotile value like "`5/9/4`" can be stored as a string, but that format does _not_ allow spatial manipulation. A geometric representation like (`-67.5, 89.9341`, `-67.5, 89.9555`, `-78.75, 89.9555`, `-78.75, 89.9341`), however, lends itself to indexing as a `geo_shape` field, which makes spatial interactions possible.

## Parameters

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`field`|Y|N/A|Field containing the geo-tile definition. The format is determined by `tile_type`|
|`tile_type`|Y|N/A|Valid formats: `geohash`, `geotile`, `geohex`|
|`children_field`|N|-|If children tiles exist, save those tiles' addresses to this field as a string array|
|`description`|N|-|Explanatory note|
|`if`|N|-|Condition to run|
|`ignore_failure`|N|`false`|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`ignore_missing`|N|`false`|If `true` and `field` does not exist or is `null`, exit quietly without making any modifications|
|`non_children_field`|N|-|If intersecting non-child tiles exist, save their addresses to this field as a string array|
|`on_failure`|N|-|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`on_success`|N|-|See [Handling Success](../handling-success.mdx)|
|`parent_field`|N|-|If a parent tile exists, save its address to this field|
|`precision_field`|N|-|Save the tile zoom rate as an integer to this field|
|`tag`|N|-|Identifier|
|`target_field`|N|`field`|Field to assign the polygon shape to|
|`target_format`|N|-|Valid options: `WKT`, `GeoJSON`|
