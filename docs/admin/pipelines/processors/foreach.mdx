# For Each

## Synopsis

```yaml {2-3}
foreach:
   - field: <ident>
   - processor: <ident>
   - description: <string>
   - if: <script>
   - ignore_failure: <logical>
   - ignore_missing: <logical>
   - on_failure: <processors...>
   - on_success: <processors...>
   - tag: <string>
```

## Description

**Functionality**: Runs a processor on each element of an array or object when the number of elements is unknown.

## Parameters

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`field`|Y|N/A|Field containing the array or object with two or more elements|
|`processor`|Y|N/A|The processor to run on each element|
|`description`|N|-|Explanatory note|
|`if`|N|-|Execute on this condition|
|`ignore_failure`|N|`false`|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`ignore_missing`|N|`false`|If `true` and `field` does not exist or is `null`, exit quietly without making any modifications|
|`on_failure`|N|-|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`on_success`|N|||
|`tag`|N|-|Identifier|

## Accessors

During iteration over an array, the current element's value is stored in the `_ingest._value` metadata field which contains the element along with its child fields, if any. These can be accessed using dot notation on this metadata field.

During iteration over an object, the current element's key is also stored as a string in `_ingest._key`.

Both of these can be accessed and modified during iteration.

## Failure Handling

If an element cannot be processed and no `on_failure` processor is specified, `foreach` exits silently leaving the entire array or object unmodified.

As this processor has to iterate multiple elements to perform its job, and as there is always the likelihood that one of them is in an invalid state, there is always the possibility of failure. Therefore, it is good practice to not leave the `on_failure` field undefined.

:::note
In the event of such a failure, elements processed thus far will remain updated.

## Examples

### Arrays

Multiple elements can be applied the same operation.

<ExampleGrid>
   <CommentCol>
      The array has three strings.
   </CommentCol>
   <CodeCol>
      ```json
      {
         "data": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
      }
      ```
   </CodeCol>
   <CommentCol>
      With this configuration...
   </CommentCol>
   <CodeCol>
      ```yaml
      foreach:
         - field: data
         - processor:
            - uppercase:
      ```
   </CodeCol>
   <CommentCol>
      ...they are converted to uppercase.
   </CommentCol>
   <CodeCol>
      ```json
      {
         "data": ["FOO", "BAR", "BAZ"]
      }
      ```
   </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Arrays of Objects

 Multiple objects with multiple fields can be applied multiple operations.

<ExampleGrid>
   <CommentCol>
      The objects in the array have an `id` field
   </CommentCol>
   <CodeCol>
      ```json
      {
         "data": [
            {"id": 1, "name": "foo"},
            {"id": 2, "name": "bar"}
         ]
      }
      ```
   </CodeCol>
   <CommentCol>
      The processor is configured to remove that field...
   </CommentCol>
   <CodeCol>
      ```yaml
      foreach:
         - field: data
         - processor:
            - remove:
               field: id
      ```
   </CodeCol>
   <CommentCol>
      ...resulting in:
   </CommentCol>
   <CodeCol>
      ```json
      {
         "data": [
            {"name": "foo"},
            {"name": "bar"}
         ]
      }
      ```
   </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Objects

Objects with multiple fields can be applied an operation.

<ExampleGrid>
   <CommentCol>
      We have 3 objects with 2 fields each:
   </CommentCol>
   <CodeCol>
   ```json
   {
      "data": {
         "foos": {
            "size": 10,
            "display_name": "Foos"
         },
         "bars": {
            "size": 20,
            "display_name": "Bars"
         },
         "quxs": {
            "size": 50,
            "display_name": ""
         }
      }
   }
   ```
   </CodeCol>
   <CommentCol>
      Convert their display names to uppercase:
   </CommentCol>
   <CodeCol>
      ```yaml
      foreach:
         - field: data
         - processor:
            - uppercase:
               - field: display_name
      ```
      ```json
      {
         "data": {
            "foos": {
               "size": 10,
               "display_name": "FOOS"
            },
            "bars": {
               "size": 20,
               "display_name": "BARS"
            },
            "quxs": {
               "size": 50
               "display_name": ""
            }
         }
      }
      ```
   </CodeCol>
</ExampleGrid>

### Cascading Failures

If multiple levels of nesting are being used, the innermost processor can be assigned the task of sending the pipeline to a failure queue for review.

```yaml
foreach:
   - field: data
   - processor:
      - remove:
         - field: id
         - on_failure:
               - id: {{{errors.id}}}
               - message: "Remove failed"
```
