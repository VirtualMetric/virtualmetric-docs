# Reroute

## Synopsis

```yaml
reroute:
  -  description: <string>
  -  destination: <string>
  -  if: <script>
  -  ignore_failure: <logical>
  -  on_failure: <processors...>
  -  on_success: <processors...>
  -  tag: <string>
```

## Description

**Functionality**: Allows routing a document to another target index or data stream.

It has two main modes:

* If the `destination` option is to be set, the target is explicitly specified, and the `dataset` and `namespace` options cannot be set.

* If the `destination` option is not set, the processor is in a data stream mode. In this mode, `reroute` can only be used on data streams that follow the data stream naming scheme. Trying to use it on a data stream with a non-compliant name will raise an exception.

The processor can use both literal values and reference fields from the document to determine the `dataset` and `namespace` of the new target.

:::warning
It is not possible to change the type of the data stream with `reroute`.
:::

When a `reroute` processor gets executed, other processors in the pipeline are skipped. If the current pipeline is executed in the context of a _Pipeline_, the calling pipeline will be skipped as well. This means that at most one `reroute` processor is ever executed within a pipeline, allowing to define mutually exclusive routing conditions.

The `reroute` processor ensures that the `data_stream.<type|dataset|namespace>` fields are set according to the new target. If the document contains an `event.dataset` value, it will be updated to reflect the same value as `data_stream.dataset`.

:::note
The client needs to have execute permissions on the final target. Otherwise, the document will be rejected with a security exception.

## Parameters

|Field|Required|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`description`|N|-|Explanatory note|
|`destination`|N|-|Field containing the destination|
|`if`|N|-|Condition to run|
|`ignore_failure`|N|`false`|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`on_failure`|N|-|See [Handling Failures](../handling-failures.mdx)|
|`on_success`|N|-|See [Handling Success](../handling-success.mdx)|
|`tag`|N|-|Identifier|

## Examples

Using the `if` option, the document can be rerouted to a new target:

```yaml
- reroute:
   tag: "review-routing"
   if: "log?.file?.path?.contains('review')"
   dataset: review
```

The processor first tries to resolve the `service.name` to determine the dataset. If that field contains `null`, does not exist, or is not a string, it tries the next element in the list which, in the example below, is "`generic`". The `namespace` is configured with a single literal value:

```yaml
- reroute:
   dataset: ["{{service.name}}", "generic"]
   namespace: default
```
