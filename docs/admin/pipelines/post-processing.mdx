# Post-processing

This is the stage where the pipelines attached to a destination do what is known as [normalization](./normalization.mdx) before the data is sent.

Here, the processors are applied to all data points, and the data is collated, analyzed, and correlated. Typically, these are processors that re-shape or aggregate the data points as per the receiver side's requirements.

**Director** offers unique features for the following:

* **Log routing**: to forward unprocessed data to multiple destinations
* **Storage optimization**: to reduce data marshalling costs
* **Query optimization**: to identify underlying patterns beforehand
* **Aggregation**: to streamline making analytic inferences
* **Anomaly detection**: to identify unusual patterns in logs for security purposes
