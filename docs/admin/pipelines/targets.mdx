# Targets

In a telemetry stream, a _Target_ is where data that was curated and transformed is directed for consumption.

## Post-processing

The post-processing stage is where the pipelines attached to a destination do, once again, [normalization](./normalization.mdx) before the data is sent to it. Here, the processors are applied to all data points. Typically, these are processors that re-shape or aggregate the data points as per the receiver side's requirements.
