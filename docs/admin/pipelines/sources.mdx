# Sources

In a telemetry stream, a _Source_ is a provider of raw or processed data.

## Pre-processing

The pre-processing stage is where the pipelines attached to a Source do what is known as [normalization](./normalization.mdx) before the data is delivered to a later stagge. Typcially, this is where the data format is transformed and perhaps certain processors are applied to all data items. Fields extracted at this stage are directed to [routes](../routes/overview.mdx).
