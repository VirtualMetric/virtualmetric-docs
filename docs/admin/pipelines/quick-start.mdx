# Pipelines: Quick Start

Creating a pipeline involves

* determining the source to ingest data from
* selecting and configuring the processors to be run

The latter also involves clarifying the sequence of execution. This requires determining whether

* the output of a specific processor needs to be fed as input to another; and
* the calculations of a latter processor can be carried out independently of a former.

Finally, given that in most real-life scenarios multiple pipelines serving various purposes will need to be run either simultaneousluy or sequentially, their purpose of use and therefore the hierarchy among them; i.e. whether they are run independently or whether they relay work to each other may also need to be considered. Again, in the latter case, their execution may need to be choreographed.

### Examples

* 1 pipeline with 2 processors that can be executed independently
* 1 pipeline with 2 processors the 1st of which relays its output to the 2nd
* 2 pipelines that run independently
* 2 pipelines one of which triggers the other upon completion
