# Pipelines: Quick Start

Creating a pipeline is a systematic process that involves two primary considerations:

1. **Data Ingestion Source**: Determining the origin of the data to be processed
2. **Processor Configuration**: Selecting and arranging processors to transform the data

## Pipeline Design Considerations

When designing a pipeline, you'll need to address several key aspects:

### Processor Sequence and Dependency

Processors can be arranged in different configurations based on their interdependence:

1. **Independent Processors**: Processors that can run simultaneously without relying on each other's output
2. **Dependent Processors**: Processors where the output of one serves as input for the next
3. **Conditional Processors**: Processors that execute based on specific conditions or previous processor results

### Pipeline Interaction Patterns

Real-world scenarios often require complex pipeline interactions:

1. **Parallel Pipelines**: Multiple pipelines running simultaneously
2. **Sequential Pipelines**: Pipelines that trigger one another upon completion
3. **Hierarchical Pipelines**: Pipelines with defined execution order and potential data relay

## Typical Pipeline Configurations

### Example 1: Independent Processors

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: simple_independent_pipeline
    processors:
      - parser  # Processor 1
      - enricher  # Processor 2 (runs independently)
```

### Example 2: Dependent Processors

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: dependent_processors_pipeline
    processors:
      - parser  # First processor
      - normalizer  # Uses output from parser
      - enricher  # Uses normalized data
```

### Example 3: Multiple Independent Pipelines

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: network_logs_pipeline
    processors:
      - network_parser
      - network_enricher

  - name: security_logs_pipeline
    processors:
      - security_parser
      - threat_detector
```

### Example 4: Sequential Pipeline Triggering

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: primary_pipeline
    processors:
      - initial_parser
    on_complete:
      trigger: secondary_pipeline

  - name: secondary_pipeline
    processors:
      - advanced_enrichment
```

## Best Practices

1. **Modularity**: Design processors to be reusable and focused on specific transformations
2. **Performance**: Consider the computational overhead of complex pipeline designs
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms
4. **Scalability**: Design pipelines that can handle varying data volumes

## Considerations for Complex Scenarios

### Performance Optimization

- Use parallel processing where possible
- Minimize unnecessary data transformations
- Choose appropriate processor order to reduce computational complexity

### Data Integrity

- Ensure consistent data typing across processors
- Implement validation steps
- Handle edge cases and unexpected input formats

## Next Steps

- Review available processors and their specific configurations
- Design your pipeline based on your specific data processing requirements
- Test and iterate on your pipeline design

:::note
Pipeline design is an iterative process. Start simple and progressively enhance your configuration as you understand your specific use cases.
