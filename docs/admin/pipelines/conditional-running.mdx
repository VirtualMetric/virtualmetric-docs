# Conditional Running

Processors support an optional `if` field, written as a script expression.

## Common Use

If provided, the processor only runs when the stated condition is met. The condition is evaluated in the ingest processor's context.

```yaml
processors:
  - drop:
    if: "_ingest.network?.name == 'Admin'"
```

### Regular Expressions

If regular expressions are enabled in the cluster setting, they can be used in the `if` condition scripts.

:::warning
As regular expressions can slow down indexing operations, it is better to avoid them whenever possible.
:::

```yaml
processors:
  - set:
    if: "_ingest_.url?.scheme =~ /^http[^s]/"
    field: url.insecure
    value: true
```

### Inline Scripting

Normally, the `if` condition must specified as a single valid JSON line. However, the console's triple quote syntax can be used to write and debug longer scripts.

:::warning
It is better to avoid using complex scripts as they may slow down the process.
:::

```yaml
processors:
  - drop:
    if: """
        Collection tags = ctx.tags;
        if (tags != null) {
          for (String tag : tags) {
            if (tag.toLowerCase().contains('foo')) {
              return false;
            }
          }
        }
        return true;
      """
```

### Stored Scripts

It is also possible to use a script stored elsewhere in the `if` condition:

```yaml
processors:
  - drop:
    if: "user_is_admin"
```

### Null Safety

When working with documents that contain objects, if a script attempts to access a field whose parent does not exist, a `NullPointerException` is returned. To avoid these, it is advisable to write the script to be null safe using operators like `?.`.

It is better, for example, to rewrite

```yaml
_ingest.network?.name.equalsIgnoreCase('Admin')
```
as

```yaml
'Admin'.equalsIgnoreCase(_ingest_.network?.name)
```

to make it null safe. If that is not possible, then it may be good practice to include an explicit null check:

```yaml
processors:
  - drop:
    if: "_ingest_.network?.name != null && ctx.network.name.contains('Admin')"
```

## Running Pipelines

The `if` condition can be combined with the `pipeline` processor to run other pipelines based on certain criteria. This can be used as the default pipeline in a template.

```yaml
processors:
  - pipeline:
    if: "_ingest.service?.name == 'foo'"
    name: foo_pipeline
  - pipeline:
    if: "_ingest.service?.name == 'bar'",
    name: bar_pipeline
  - fail:
    if: "_ingest.service?.name != 'foo' && _ingest.service?.name != 'bar'"
    message: "Either `foo` or `bar` must be present"
```
