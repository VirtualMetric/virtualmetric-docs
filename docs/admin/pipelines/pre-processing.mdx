# Pre-processing

This is the stage where the pipelines attached to a Source perform a number of operations before the data is delivered to a later stage such as indexing or analysis.

Typcially, this is where the data format is modified after processors are applied to various data points. Fields extracted at this stage are directed to [Routes](../routes/overview.mdx).

**Director** offers unique features to handle the following:

* **Data reduction**: filtering and sampling to reduce noise
* **Field mapping**: lightweight processing to clean and enrich data during ingestion
* **Field tagging**: adding contextual metadata to aid analysis downstream
* **Data enrichment**: collating and correlating data with other contextually relevant information to aid analysis downstream
* **Transformation**: parsing, redacting sensitive information, reformatting log entries
* **Normalization**: converting mutually incompatible log formats to structured schemas
