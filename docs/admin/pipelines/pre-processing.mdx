# Pre-processing

This is the stage where the pipelines attached to a Source perform a number of operations before the data is delivered to a later stage such as indexing or analysis.

Typcially, this is where the data format is modified after processors are applied to various data points. Fields extracted at this stage are directed to [Routes](../routes/overview.mdx).

**Director** offers unique features for the following:

* **Data reduction**: to lower the downstream costs by reducing noise during ingestion with lightweight processing, cleaning, and sampling
* **Normalization**: to convert mutually incompatible log formats to structured, easily-manageable schemas
* **Data enrichment**: to aid analysis downstream by
	* tagging with contextual metadata
	* collating and correlating with other relevant information
* **Transformation**: to respect data privacy by parsing and redacting sensitive information, and reformatting log entries
