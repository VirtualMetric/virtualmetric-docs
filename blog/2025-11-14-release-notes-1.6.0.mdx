This release introduces powerful new capabilities for pipeline management and multi-tenant security. The new **Pipeline Updates** system provides intelligent update notifications with side-by-side comparison, while **Sub-Tenant Access Control** enhances security with approval-based workflows for parent tenant access. We've expanded platform capabilities with **Advanced Route Scheduling**, **Director Filtering**, and **Linux Agent** enhancements, plus comprehensive **Windows DNS Logs Filtering**. Important bug fixes improve configuration persistence and cross-browser compatibility.
