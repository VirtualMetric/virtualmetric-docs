This security hotfix addresses authentication vulnerabilities in the login system. We've enhanced session generation and login logic to prevent email enumeration attacks and mitigate timing-based attack vectors, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of user existence.

### Authentication Hardening

- **Email Enumeration Prevention** - Enhanced login logic to prevent attackers from determining whether an email address exists in the system. The authentication response now behaves consistently for both existing and non-existing users, eliminating information leakage through response variations.

- **Timing Attack Mitigation** - Implemented consistent computational effort during authentication regardless of user existence or password validation outcome. Fixed-salt hash comparison ensures uniform response times, preventing timing-based user enumeration.

- **Consistent CAPTCHA Behavior** - Updated failed login attempt handling to apply CAPTCHA requirements uniformly for both existing and non-existing users, preventing behavioral fingerprinting.
