# Release Notes for v1.3.0

This release introduces major enterprise-focused features, along with important improvements in content management. With Single Sign-On, RBAC, and the first phase of the MSSP module, our platform becomes more secure, flexible, and enterprise-ready than ever before. Weâ€™ve also added more vendors to the Content Hub and introduced Auto Syslog Discovery to simplify log management.

## :rocket: New Features

**Single Sign-On (SSO) with Microsoft Azure** - Users can now log in directly with their Azure credentials, reducing password fatigue and improving security.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Introduced predefined roles (Admin, Contributor, User) and support for creating custom roles. This gives organizations fine-grained control over access and permissions.

**MSSP Module (Phase 1)** - Enterprise customers can now create and manage sub-tenants, switch between tenants, and define usage limits. This is the foundation for future phases, which will bring advanced capabilities like shared pipelines and global dashboards.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Authentication method allowing users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials, integrated with Microsoft Azure AD for enhanced security, reduced password fatigue, and centralized access management
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Fine-grained access management system with predefined roles (Admin, Contributor, User) and customizable roles for Enterprise plan users, providing structured access control and scalable permission management
- **MSSP Support (Phase 1)** - Managed Security Service Provider module enabling Enterprise-level customers to manage multiple tenants under a single account, offering centralized tenant management, quick switching between tenants, and enhanced operational efficiency with usage visibility and control
