## :rocket: New Features

- **CAPTCHA Security Enhancement** - CAPTCHA verification implemented across authentication workflows to protect against automated attacks. CAPTCHA challenges added to login, signup, and password reset processes, preventing unauthorized access attempts and bot-based attacks while maintaining smooth user experience for legitimate access.

- **Tenant Limit Management Enhancement** - Parent tenant limit configuration enhanced with self-management capabilities, providing greater control over resource allocation across organizational hierarchies. Parent tenants can now configure their own limits directly, with changes automatically affecting sub-tenant limit allocation. License limits calculated as combined total of parent tenant and all sub-tenants, ensuring accurate resource tracking across entire tenant structure.
