title: Version 1.3.0 Released

---

This release introduces major enterprise-focused features, along with important improvements in content management. With **Single Sign-On**, **RBAC**, and the first phase of the **MSSP** module, our platform becomes more secure, flexible, and enterprise-ready than ever before. We've also added more vendors to the **Content Hub** and introduced **Auto Syslog Discovery** to simplify log management.
