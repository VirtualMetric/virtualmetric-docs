This maintenance release addresses a critical configuration management issue. We've fixed a bug where configuration strings sent from the web interface to the Director could be incorrectly formatted, preventing proper configuration application and data flow. This fix ensures reliable configuration transmission and uninterrupted telemetry processing.
